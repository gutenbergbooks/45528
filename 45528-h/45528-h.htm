<h2>THE BEST MAN</h2>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p>CARRINGTON folded the document
and thoughtfully balanced
it on his palm. What an ironical
old world it was! There was a perpendicular
wrinkle about his nose, and his
lips had thinned into a mere line which
drooped at the corners. The drone of a
type-writer in the adjoining room sounded
above the rattle-tattle of the street
below. Through the opened windows
came a vague breath of summer redolent
of flowers and grasses; for it was but
eleven o&#39;clock of the morning, and the
smell of sun-baked brick and asphalt had
not yet risen through the air. Far beyond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
the smoking, ragged sky-line Carrington
could see the shifting, glittering river and
the great ships going down to the sea.
Presently the ashes from his dead cigar
fell in a gray cascade down his coat and
tumbled across his knees, but he gave no
heed.</p>

<p class="indent">Ironical old world indeed! Here, suddenly
and unexpectedly, he found himself
upon the battle-field of love and duty,
where all honest men find themselves,
sooner or later. To pit the heart against
the conscience, impulse against calculation!
Heigh-ho! Duty is an implacable
goddess, and those who serve her most
loyally are most ruthlessly driven. She
buffets us into this corner and into that,
digs pitfalls for the hesitant foot, and
crushes the vacillating.</p>

<p class="indent">As all men will, Carrington set about
to argue down his conscience; the heart is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
so insistent a counselor. Why should he
give up the woman he loved, simply because
duty demanded he should? After
all, was not duty merely social obligation?
What was it to him that the sheep were
sheared? Was it right that he, of all men,
should divide the house, throw the black
pall of dishonesty over it, destroy his own
happiness and hers, when so simple a
thing as a match would crumble into
nothingness this monument to one man&#39;s
greed and selfishness? The survival of
the fittest; if he put aside Self, who would
thank him? Few, and many would call
him a fool or a meddler. So many voices
spoke that he seemed to hear none distinctly.</p>

<p class="indent">He alone had made these astonishing
discoveries; he alone had followed the
cunningly hidden trail of the serpent. He
could stop where he was and none would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
be the wiser. To be sure, it was only a
question of time when the scandal would
become public through other channels;
but in that event he would not be held
responsible for bringing about the catastrophe.
Besides, the ways of the serpent
are devious and many, and other
investigators might not come so close to
the trail.</p>

<p class="indent">He had gone about his investigations
without the least idea where they would
lead him. At the beginning he had believed
that the guilty ones were none
higher than petty officials; but presently
he found himself going over their heads,
higher and higher, until, behold! he was
at the lair of the old serpent himself. A
client had carelessly dropped a bit of information,
and it had taken seed with
this surprising result. Henry Cavenaugh,
millionaire promoter, financier, trust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
magnate, director in a hundred money-gathering
concerns; Henry Cavenaugh,
the father of the girl he loved and who
loved him! Could it be he, indeed? It
seemed incredible.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not a case of misappropriation
of funds, such as a man may be guilty of
when temporarily hard pressed. It was
a bold and fraudulent passing of dividends
that rightfully belonged to the
investors; of wrongfully issuing statements
of bolstered expenses, lack of
markets, long strikes (promoted by Cavenaugh
and his associates!), insufficient
means of transportation. An annual dividend
of seven per cent. on many millions
had been dishonestly passed over.
The reports that there would be no dividends
encouraged a slump in the listed
price of the stock, and many had sold
under par value, thereby netting to Cavenaugh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
and others several millions. And
the proof of all this lay in his hand!</p>

<p class="indent">It had been a keen hunt. Many and
many a blind trail had he followed, only
to come back to the start again. All that
now remained for him to do was to pass
this document on to the hands of the intrepid
district attorney, and justice would
be meted out to the guilty.</p>

<p class="indent">Her father! The picture of him rose
suddenly and distinctly in his mind. Tall,
powerfully built, a hooked nose, keen
blue eyes, an aggressive chin, a repellent
mouth, Henry Cavenaugh was the personification
of the modern Cr&oelig;sus. Immutable
in purpose, dogged in perseverance,
a relentless enemy, a Jesuit in that
the end always justified the means, he
stood a pillar in the world of finance,
where there is sometimes justice but never
any mercy. Thirty-five years before he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
had been a messenger in a stock-broker&#39;s
office. Of his antecedents nothing was
known until he broke one of the famous
gold corners in the seventies, when a
handsome, ruddy-cheeked little Irishman
bobbed up serenely from nowhere in particular
and claimed to be the great Cavenaugh&#39;s
father. But his proofs were not
convincing, and when the son showed a
decided contempt for him, he gently subsided
into oblivion and was heard of no
more. From time to time Carrington
gathered a small crumb of information
regarding his sweetheart&#39;s grandfather;
but whenever he broached the subject,
however tactfully, everybody concerned
headed the conversation for a different
port.</p>

<p class="indent">Carrington had never laid eyes on the
old gentleman, and, for all he knew to the
contrary, he might be a myth. He reasoned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
that in all probability the grandfather
was illiterate, uncouth, and rather
an awkward piece of family furniture to
handle, when the family proper were ingratiating
themselves into the Chippendales
of society. Unfortunately, Mother
Cavenaugh, good-hearted and amiable in
her way, had been stung by the bee of the
climbers, and her one ambition was to
establish herself and daughters in society;
and had not he, Carrington, come of an
aristocratic family (poor, it is true), the
doors of the Cavenaugh manor would
never have opened to his knock. Even as
it was, he was <i>persona non grata</i> to the
millionaire, who was mad for a duke in
the family. Besides, Cavenaugh had his
suspicions of any lawyer who grubbed
outside the breastworks.</p>

<p class="indent">Some doves circled above a church-spire
a few streets over the way, breaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
the sunbeams against their polished
wings. Finally they settled on the slate
roof and fell to strutting and waddling
and swelling their breasts pompously.
Carrington opened and refolded the document,
but he did not take his eyes from
the doves. What should he do? What ill
wind had blown this thing into his doorway?
Nothing had warned him of the
impending tangle. Until two days ago
Cavenaugh was at the other end of the
world, so far as his investigations at that
time were concerned.</p>

<p class="indent">He struck a match. The sliver of pine
flared palely in the sunshine, writhed
and dropped, black and charred, to the
floor. He shrugged his shoulders. Chivalry
of this sort was not the order of the
day. There was something stronger than
the voice of duty, something stronger
than the voice of the heart; it was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
voice of pity, which urged its appeal for
the hundreds of men and women who
had invested their all in the Cavenaugh
concerns. The thought of their ultimate
ruin, should Cavenaugh be permitted to
pursue his course unchecked, bore heavily
upon him. No, he could not do it.
He must fight, even if he lost his all in
the battle. It is a fine thing to right a
wrong. All the great victories in the
world have been won for others than the
victors. That Cavenaugh was the father
of the girl he loved must have no weight
on the scales of justice.</p>

<p class="indent">Resolutely he thrust the document into
his coat pocket, closed his desk and relighted
his cigar. In that moment he had
mapped out his plan of action. That very
night he would lay the whole thing very
clearly before the girl herself, and whatever
decision she made, he would stand or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
fall by it, for he knew her to be the soul
of honor.</p>

<p class="indent">Poor girl! It was a heart-breaking
business. How in the world should he
begin, and where should he stop? Ah,
that was it! He would lay the matter before
her in a manner that would conceal
the vital nearness of the case, as if it were
some client of his who was unknown to
her. And when she had judged the case,
he would speak the bald truth. It would
be a cruel blow, but nevertheless he must
deal it. She loved her father, and after
his own peculiar fashion her father loved
her. She was the only one in the family
who could wheedle him out of a purpose;
to the rest of the family his word was law
immutable. It was very hard, sighed Carrington.
For the father he had neither
pity nor sympathy; there were many ugly
tales about his financial dealings; but his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
whole heart went out unreservedly to the
girl.</p>

<p class="indent">When Carrington had gone to Cavenaugh,
his heart in his throat, to speak to
him relative to his daughter&#39;s hand, he
unwittingly knocked off the top of a volcano.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Marry my daughter?&quot; Cavenaugh
roared, emphasizing his wrath and disapproval
with a bang of fist upon palm.
&quot;My daughter shall marry only among
her equals, not among her inferiors. A
king is not good enough for my Kate.&quot;
There was another bang of the fist, decided
and final. &quot;A lawyer? Not if I
know myself. I wouldn&#39;t trust a lawyer
out of sight,&quot; bluntly. &quot;Kate shall marry
a duke or a prince, if I can find one suitable.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Carrington would have smiled had the
moment been less serious.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
&quot;No man can possibly appreciate her
worth more readily than I, sir,&quot; he replied,
&quot;or love her more dearly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Love?&quot; with a snort. &quot;Twaddle out
of story-books!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you yourself love her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m her father,&quot; Cavenaugh returned
complacently, adding a gesture which
had the effect of describing the fact that
it was perfectly logical for a father to
love his daughter, but that it wasn&#39;t logical
at all for any other male biped to
love her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sorry,&quot; said the disheartened
suitor, rising. &quot;I suppose that after this
unpleasant interview ...&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you&#39;re a decent sort,&quot; interrupted
Cavenaugh generously; &quot;and if you are
of a mind to behave yourself hereafter,
you will always find a chair at my table.
But my daughter is not for you, sir, emphatically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
not. That is all, sir;&quot; and
Cavenaugh picked up his evening paper.</p>

<p class="indent">After such a rebuff, most young men
would have given up; but Carrington
never gave up till there was no possibility
of winning. Immediately after the interview
he went to the higher court with his
appeal.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let us have patience,&quot; the girl whispered.
&quot;I&#39;ll undertake to bring him to
reason.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Carrington went home that night
without his love for the father increasing
any.</p>

<p class="indent">And so the matter stood at the present
time. The affair had gone neither forward
nor backward.</p>

<p class="indent">Ah, were he less honest, how easily he
could bring the old curmudgeon to terms!
There was that in his pocket which would
open the way to the altar, quickly enough.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
But Carrington was manly and honest to
the core, and to him blackmail stood
among the basest of crimes. Many times
during the past forty-eight hours the
tempter had whispered in his ear that
here was a way out of his difficulties; but
the young man had listened unmoved.</p>

<p class="indent">During the summer and autumn
months of the year the Cavenaughs lived
at their country place over in New Jersey,
and there Carrington spent the week-ends.
There were horses to ride, golf and tennis,
and a Saturday night dance at the Country
Club. To be with the girl you love,
even if you can&#39;t have her, is some compensation.
Cavenaugh never joined the
fêtes and sports of the summer colonists,
but he offered no objections to the feminine
members of his household for selecting
Carrington as their escort for the
week-ends. Indeed, by now he began to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
consider Carrington as a harmless, sensible,
well-groomed young man, who relieved
him of all the painful duties to the
frivolous. If the colonists insisted on
coupling his daughter&#39;s name with Carrington&#39;s,
let them do so; when the proper
moment came he would disillusionize
them. For himself, he always had some
good old crony down to while away the
dull Sundays; and together they consummated
plans that gave the <i>coup de grâce</i>
to many a noble business galleon. This
particular summer there were no dukes
or princes floating around unattached,
and Cavenaugh agreed that it was a commendable
time to lay devices by which to
ambush the winter money.</p>

<p class="indent">There were nights when Cavenaugh
did not sleep very well; but of this, more
anon.</p>

<p class="indent">Shortly after his determination to tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
Kate half a truth, Carrington left the office
and made an early train into New
Jersey. All the way over to the Cavenaugh
station he was restless and uneasy.
The fatal papers still reposed in his
pocket. He had not dared to leave them
in the office safe; his partner, who had
had no hand in the investigation, might
stumble across them, and that was the last
thing in the world he desired. He knew
not exactly what to do with them; for
they burned like fire in his pocket, and
seemed to scorch his fingers whenever he
touched them to learn if they were still
there. A thousand and one absurd suppositions
assailed him. Supposing, for
instance, there should be a wreck; supposing
he should be robbed; supposing he
should leave his vest on the links; and so
forth and so forth. It was very depressing.
If only he stood in the open, unhandicapped;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
if only he might throw the gauntlet
at Cavenaugh&#39;s feet the moment they
met!</p>

<p class="indent">Ah, if he had only attended to his own
affairs! But he hadn&#39;t; and his inquisitiveness
had plunged him into a Chinese
tangle from which there seemed to be no
exit. But there was an exit; only, if at
that moment Cassandra had whispered
the secret into his ear, it would have appealed
to him as the most improbable
thing under the sun. However, there are
no trustworthy Cassandras these sordid
days; a single look into the future costs
a dollar; and as for Greek choruses, they
trundle push-carts on the East Side.</p>

<p class="indent">He had broken bread and eaten salt at
Cavenaugh&#39;s table; and now it was decreed
that he must betray him. It was not
a pleasant thought. And still less pleasant
was the thought of telling Kate (in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
a roundabout fashion, it is true) that her
father was not an honest man. According
to financial ethics, what Cavenaugh did
was simply keen business instinct; nothing
more. If you or I should happen to
bend an odd cornice of the majestic pillar
of law, we&#39;d be haled off to the county
jail forthwith; but if we possessed the
skill to smash the whole fabric or rather,
to continue the metaphor, the whole pillar,
the great world would sit up and admire
us. What are old laws for, anyhow?
Build you never so wisely your law, there
will always be some one to come along
and tack on a nice little amendment,
subtly undoing in a moment what it took
years of labor to accomplish. In this instance,
Cavenaugh had been careless; he
had forgotten to introduce his amendment.
An infinitesimal grain of sand will
stop the best regulated clock. The infallible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
invariably die on the heels of
their first victory.</p>

<p class="indent">On leaving the train, Carrington espied
the Cavenaugh station carriage. The
coachman was talking to a little wiry old
man, whose gray eyes twinkled and whose
complexion was mottled and withered
like a wind-fall apple. Seeing Carrington
draw nigh, the coachman touched his
hat respectfully, while the little old man,
who was rather shabbily dressed, stepped
quickly around the corner of the platform.
Evidently he did not wish to be inspected
at close range. Carrington threw
his suit-case and golf-bag into the carriage,
and followed them. Thereupon the
coachman touched the horses lightly, and
they started westward at a brisk trot.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who&#39;s your friend?&quot; asked Carrington,
who, though never familiar, was always
friendly toward his inferiors.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
&quot;He&#39;s no friend of mine, sir,&quot; answered
the coachman, with well-bred contempt.
&quot;Miss Cavenaugh directed me to drive
you straight to the club, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well,&quot; replied Carrington, lighting
a cigar and settling back among the
cushions.</p>

<p class="indent">Immediately he forgot all about the
shabby old man, and began to inventory
his troubles. He must hide the papers
somewhere. All the evidence he had, together
with the names of the witnesses,
was on his person; for in making the
whole he had prudently destroyed the
numerous scraps. If this document fell
into alien hands, the trouble would double
itself. He puffed quickly, and the heat of
the cigar put a smart on his tongue. He
had nothing to do but wait.</p>

<p class="indent">On the steps of the club&#39;s porte-cochère
he was greeted by Miss Cavenaugh, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
was simply and tastefully dressed in
white. If there was a sudden cardiac disturbance
in Carrington&#39;s breast, the girl&#39;s
tender beauty certainly justified it. The
fresh color on her cheeks and lips, the
shining black hair that arched a white
forehead, the darkly fringed blue eyes,
the slender, rounded figure, the small feet
and shapely hands, all combined to produce
a picture of feminine loveliness
warranted to charm any masculine eye.
Let the curious question Cavenaugh&#39;s antecedents,
if they were so inclined,
thought Carrington; here was abundant
evidence of what a certain old poet called
the splendid corpuscle of aristocracy.</p>

<p class="indent">Her sister went by the sonorous name
of Norah. She was seventeen, a bit of a
tomboy, but of the same build and elegant
carriage that distinguished Kate
from ordinary mortals; only Norah&#39;s eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
were hazel-tinted and her hair was that
warm brown of the heart of a chestnut-bur.
She was of merry temperament,
quick to like or to dislike, and like her
sister, loyal to those she loved. Both girls
possessed that uncommon gift in women,
the perfect sense of justice. You never
heard them gossiping about anybody; and
when a veranda conversation drifted toward
scandal, the Cavenaugh girls invariably
drifted toward the farther end
of the veranda. All the men admired
them; they were such good fellows.</p>

<p class="indent">The mother of the girls was, as I have
remarked, good-natured and amiable, inclined
toward stoutness, and a willing
listener to all that was going on. She considered
it her bounden duty to keep informed
regarding the doings of her intimate
friends, but with total lack of
malice. At this moment she occupied her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
favorite corner on the club veranda, and
was engaged in animated tittle-tattle. She
nodded and smiled at Carrington.</p>

<p class="indent">Norah was playing tennis. She waved
her racket at the new arrival. Carrington
was her beau-ideal.</p>

<p class="indent">He hurried into the dressing-room and
shortly returned in his golf flannels. He
was a sturdy chap, not at all handsome,
but possessing a countenance full of strong
lines. He inspired your trust and confidence,
which is far better than inspiring
your admiration.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not going to play to-day,&quot; said
Kate, &quot;so I&#39;ll follow over the course and
watch you play. I haven&#39;t seen you for a
whole week; and I can&#39;t talk and play,
too,&quot; smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forward, then!&quot; cried Carrington,
beckoning to his caddy.</p>

<p class="indent">He played a nervous, fidgety game that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
afternoon. Every time he teed his ball the
document spoke from his pocket with an
ominous crackle. There was not one brilliant
stroke to his credit. This puzzled
the girl, for only the previous week he
had been runner-up in the annual tournament
for crack amateurs. He made the
ninth hole indifferently, then turned to
the girl, smiling whimsically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are not playing up to your form
to-day, John,&quot; she observed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I admit it,&quot; he replied, tossing his club
to the caddy, who, well versed in worldly
affairs, serenely shouldered the bag and
made off toward the club house. &quot;My
heart isn&#39;t in the game, Kate. The fact is,
I&#39;m in a peck of trouble.&quot; He determined
to tell her at once. There might not be
another opportunity like this.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, John!&quot; reproachfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, it came only yesterday. I haven&#39;t
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
been hiding it. I&#39;m in a kind of pocket,
and can&#39;t exactly see my way out. I want
your advice; and you must be the jury and
judge rolled into one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They were standing on a hill, and far
away they could see the pale line where
the shimmering summer sea met the turquoise
bowl of heaven.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me what your difficulty is, John,
and I will judge it the best I know how.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He never knew what a simple, beautiful
name John was till it fell from the
lips of this girl. Many called him Jack;
but only his mother and this girl called
him John. He motioned toward the sandbox,
and they sat down. The other players
were well scattered about, out of hearing.
He made out his case skilfully
enough, giving his plaintiff and defendant
fictitious names. The thing grew so
real to him, as he went on, that toward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
the end he rose to the dramatics. The girl
listened, but with never a glance at him.
Rather her gaze roved over the dancing
gray waters and followed the lonely white
sail that stood out to sea. And when he
reached the climax, silence of some duration
fell upon them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Should this man be punished?&quot; he
asked at length.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is guilty; he has broken two laws,
the civic and human. Oh, the poor people!&quot;
pathetically. &quot;They are never at
peace; the wolf harries them, and the
jackal; they are robbed, beaten and
spurned. They are like sheep, not knowing
how to fight. They arrest a man for
his poverty; they applaud him for his
greed. It is all very wrong.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sail fell under the shadow of a
cloud, and they both watched it till it
flashed into the sunlight again.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
&quot;A woman&#39;s intuition is sometimes abnormally
keen. You are strong enough
to fight such things without the advice of
a woman. Is there not something vital to
me in all this? Is it not ... is it not
my father, John?&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span></p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p>CARRINGTON faced her swiftly.
He had not expected this. There
was something in her handsome
eyes that barred the way to subterfuge.
The lie died unspoken, and he dropped
his gaze and began to dig up the turf
with the toe of his shoe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it my father, John?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Oh, Kate,&quot; with a despairing
gesture, &quot;I&#39;m the most miserable fellow
alive! To think that this should fall into
my hands, of all hands in the world!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps it is better so,&quot; quietly.
&quot;Nothing is without purpose. It might
have come to test your honesty. But you
are sure, John; it is not guess-work?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All the evidence is in my pocket. Say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
the word, and the wind shall carry it
down to the sea. Say the word, heart o&#39;
mine!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He made a quick movement toward his
pocket, but she caught his arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do nothing foolish or hasty, John.
Tearing up the evidence would not undo
what is done. Sooner or later murder
will out. If my father is culpable, if in
his thoughtless greed for money he has
robbed the poor, he must be made to restore
what he has taken. I know my father;
what he has done appears perfectly
legitimate to him. Can he be put in
prison?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It all depends upon how well he defends
himself,&quot; evasively.</p>

<p class="indent">She went on. &quot;I have been dreading
something like this; so it is no great surprise
to me. He is money-mad, money-mad;
and he hears, sees, thinks nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
but money. But it hurts, John; I am a
proud woman. My grandfather....&quot;
Her lips shut suddenly. &quot;Money!&quot; with
a passionate wave of the hand. &quot;How I
hate the name of it, the sound of it, the
thought of it! I love my father,&quot; with a
defiant pride; &quot;he has always been tender
and kind to me; and I should not be
of his flesh and blood had I not the desire
to shield and protect him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The remedy is simple and close at
hand,&quot; suggested Carrington gently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Simple, but worthy of neither of us.
I abhor anything that is not wholly honest.
It is one of those strange freaks of
nature (who holds herself accountable to
no one) to give to me honesty that is the
sum total of what should have been evenly
distributed among my ancestors. If I
were to tell all I know, all I have kept
locked in my heart....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
&quot;Don&#39;t do it, girl; it wouldn&#39;t matter
in the least. You are you; and that is all
there is to love. Why, I could not love
you less if your great-great-grandfather
was a pirate,&quot; lightly. &quot;Love asks no
questions; and ancestors worry me not at
all; they are all comfortably dead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not always. But if my perception of
honor were less keen, I should laugh at
what you call your evidence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Laugh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, indeed. I very well understand
the tremendous power of money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not more than I,&quot; sadly.</p>

<p class="indent">She laughed brokenly. &quot;More than
you. I can picture to you just what will
happen.&quot; She rose. &quot;There will, of
course, be a great newspaper clamor; the
interstate commissioners will put their
heads together; there will be investigations
by the government. That will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
the attack. The keenest lawyers are on the
side of corporations; that is because the
state is niggard with her pay. Let me outline
the defense. Father will resign from
his high office, to be reëlected later when
the public cools off! A new directorate
will fill the place of the present one. Suddenly
falsified entries will be discovered;
the head bookkeeper will have disappeared.
All fingers will point to him. He
will be in South America, having been
paid several thousand to go there. All
this will make the passing of the dividend
perfectly logical. The matter will never
be tried in court. Money will do all this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear little woman, you reason like
Pythagoras; but,&quot; Carrington added
gravely, &quot;when I undertook to untangle
this affair, I realized its huge proportions.
For every redoubt your father has, I have
an assault, for every wall a catapult, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
every gate a petard. But, as I said before,
you have only to say the word, and for the
present nobody will be any the wiser.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I permitted you to do this, I should
destroy my faith in both of us. It would
erect a barrier which would be insurmountable.
That is not the way out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have weighed all these things,&quot; discouragedly.</p>

<p class="indent">He took the document from his pocket
and caught it in a way that indicated how
easily it might be ripped into halves, the
halves into quarters, the quarters into infinitesimal
squares of meaningless letters.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Once more, shall I, Kate?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, John. That would only make our
difficulties greater. But I do ask this one
favor; put your evidence into the hands
of a strange attorney, have nothing to do
with the prosecution; for my sake.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must have the night to think it over.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
Most of my attacks are not herein written;
I dared keep them only in my head.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am very unhappy,&quot; said the girl.</p>

<p class="indent">He took her hand and kissed it reverently.
He longed to console her, but no
words he had in mind seemed adequate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fore!&quot; came lazily over the knoll.
They were no longer alone. So together
they wandered slowly back to the club-house.
Tea was being served, and Carrington
drank his abstractedly. From
time to time he joined the conversation,
but without any heart. Some of the busier
ladies whispered that it looked this time
as though Kate had given the young man
his <i>congé</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">On the way home Norah, with her humorous
comment on the weekly budget
of gossip, saved the situation from any
possible <i>contretemps</i>. Mrs. Cavenaugh
was easy-going, but for all that she possessed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
remarkably observant eyes; and her
eldest daughter was glad that they were
occupied elsewhere.</p>

<p class="indent">Kate was very unhappy; her father was
not honest, and the man she loved had
come into the knowledge of the fact. Ah,
how quickly shadow can darken sunshine!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did you make it in to-day, Mr.
Carrington?&quot; asked Norah.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Make what?&quot; he counter-questioned
absently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The course, Mr. Goose! What did
you think I meant?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh,&quot; lamely, &quot;I made a bad play at
the beginning, and gave it up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">By this time they had arrived at the
gates, and everybody was thankful; Mrs.
Cavenaugh, because her nose smarted
with sunburn; Norah, because the gown
she was to wear at the dance that night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
was new; Kate, because she wanted to be
alone; and Carrington, because he wanted
to learn whether the Angel threw Jacob
or Jacob threw the Angel. The driver
and the horses were glad to arrive because
they were hungry.</p>

<p class="indent">It took the young lawyer some time to
dress for dinner that night. His usually
direct mind vacillated between right and
wrong, wrong and right; and he floated
from one to the other like an unattached
cork. He made a dozen annoying blunders
in dressing. And when finally the
pier-glass reflected an irreproachable
and finished picture, he searched his cast-off
vest for his growing monster and
transferred it to the pocket of his coat.
Monster! Here was no story-monster,
like the creature of a Frankenstein; it
was genuine, and was like to turn upon
him at any moment and rend him. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
shrugged and proceeded down the stairs.
There are soliloquies that sometimes leave
an unpleasant taste behind. So he pinned
his faith to the banner of the late genial
and hopeful Micawber: something might
turn up for the benefit of all concerned.</p>

<p class="indent">The hall and living-room at the Cavenaugh
manor were one and the same.
There were bookcases ranging along the
walls, window-seats, a reading-table and
an ancient chimney-seat. As Carrington
turned the first landing he stopped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father, I think it positively dreadful
the way you treat poor grandpa.&quot; This
was Norah.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a crackle of a newspaper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind, Norah, darling; your
grandpa is used to it. It doesn&#39;t matter
at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was the sight of the last speaker that
brought Carrington to a stand. Norah&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
grandpa was no less a person than the
shabbily dressed old man he had seen at
the station that afternoon. What kind of
family skeleton in the closet was he that
they kept him <i>en camera</i>? He coughed
and went on.</p>

<p class="indent">Norah was plucky, whole-hearted,
frank and encouraging.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Carrington,&quot; she said immediately,
&quot;this is my grandpa.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Carrington did not hesitate a moment,
but smiled and thrust out his hand, which
the other grasped with a questioning air
of diffidence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Glad to meet you, sir,&quot; said Carrington.</p>

<p class="indent">Cavenaugh <i>fils</i> glanced over the top of
his paper, scowled, and resumed his reading.
Kate hadn&#39;t come down yet, so she
missed this scene. When she did appear,
there was no visible sign of any previous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
agitation. She and Norah were thoroughbreds.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, grandpa!&quot; she cried, extending
her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">The old man bowed over it and kissed
it, and his action was lacking neither in
grace nor gallantry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I happened to be down this way on
business,&quot; said the old man with a covert
glance at his son, &quot;and thought I&#39;d drop
in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dinner is served,&quot; said the splendid
butler, as he slid back the doors to the
dining-room.</p>

<p class="indent">The old man looked about him questioningly,
and Norah slipped her arm
through his. &quot;You&#39;ll have to take me in,
grandpa,&quot; she laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">The old man&#39;s eyes shone for a moment,
and he patted her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m as proud as a king, Norah.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
Now, Carrington could read between
the lines. It was manifestly plain that
grandpa was not welcome to Cavenaugh.
But why? Mrs. Cavenaugh scarcely tolerated
him. While the girls seldom if
ever spoke of him, it was evident that both
held him in their affections. There were
many strange things going on in the
Cavenaugh manor; and Carrington entered
the dining-room in a subdued state
of mind.</p>

<p class="indent">By degrees Norah succeeded in drawing
the pariah out of himself. Carrington
was soon listening to an amazing
range of adventures. The old man had
seen Cuba in the filibusters&#39; time, he had
fought the Canadian constabulary as a
Fenian, he had been a sailor, and had
touched the shores of many strange lands.
Grandpa Cavenaugh was anything but illiterate.
Quite often there was a flash of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
wit, a well-turned phrase, a quotation.
He had, besides, a comprehensive grasp
of the politics of all countries.</p>

<p class="indent">Carrington saw at once that his half-formed
opinion was a house of cards.
There was no reason in the world why
they should be ashamed of him, shunt
him off into the side-track of obscurity,
and begrudge him a plate at the table.
Carrington realized that he was very close
to some peculiar mystery, and that the old
man&#39;s bitterest enemy was his son.</p>

<p class="indent">Throughout the meal the millionaire
preserved a repelling silence. From time
to time, when there was laughter, he
scowled. Once or twice Mrs. Cavenaugh
essayed to pass an observation across the
table to him, but a curt nod was all she
received for her pains. Presently Cavenaugh
dropped his knife on his plate, and
the pariah retreated meekly into his shell.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
In fact, he looked frightened, as if the
thought had come to him that he had
made an irreparable blunder in warming
under his grandchildren&#39;s smiles.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Carrington,&quot; said Midas, balling his
napkin and tossing it on the table, &quot;your
particular branch is corporation law, isn&#39;t
it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. The firm has some reputation in
that branch.&quot; Carrington glanced curiously
at his host. What was coming now?
Was it possible that Cavenaugh had in
some way learned of his discoveries and
was about to placate him?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe you handled successfully the
D. &amp; M. railroad deal?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We won in three courts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; continued Cavenaugh, &quot;I&#39;ve
been thinking of you to-day. The P. &amp; O.
counsel has had to give up on account of
poor health, and Matthewson spoke to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
me yesterday, asking if I knew a man
who could fill his place. It pays seventeen
thousand the year.&quot; He paused as if
to let this magnificent salary sink into the
deepest crevice of Carrington&#39;s soul.
&quot;What would you say to a permanent
berth like that?&quot; Cavenaugh positively
beamed.</p>

<p class="indent">Kate stared at her father in astonishment.
Was it possible that he was beginning
to look favorably upon Carrington?
Her glance traveled to Carrington. His
expression she found puzzling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Seventeen thousand!&quot; murmured the
pariah, rubbing his hands, while his eyes
sparkled.</p>

<p class="indent">Carrington deliberated for a space.
He was hard put. He did not want to
refuse this peace-offering, but nothing
would make him accept it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is very fine of you. Two years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
ago I should have jumped at the chance.
But my agreement with my partner makes
it impossible. I can not honestly break
my contract within five years.&quot; He
waited for the storm to burst, for Cavenaugh
was not a patient man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you mad?&quot; whispered Kate. A
flush of anger swept over her at the
thought of Carrington&#39;s lightly casting
aside this evident olive-branch.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would you have me accept it?&quot; he returned,
in a whisper lower than hers.</p>

<p class="indent">She paled. &quot;I had forgotten,&quot; she said,
with the pain of quick recollection.</p>

<p class="indent">The dinner came to its end, and everybody
rose gratefully, for there seemed to
be something tense in the air.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Seventeen thousand honest dollars!&quot;
murmured the pariah, tagging along at
the millionaire&#39;s heels.</p>

<p class="indent">Carrington threw him a swift penetrating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
glance; but the old man was looking
ecstatically at the tinted angels on the ceiling.
The old man might be perfectly
guileless; but Carrington scented the
faintly bitter aroma of irony.</p>

<p class="indent">Just before the carriage arrived to convey
Carrington and the ladies to the club
dance, grandpa appeared, hat in hand and
a humble smile on his face. It was a very
attractive face, weather-beaten though it
was, penciled by the onset of seventy
years.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are not going, are you, grandpa?&quot;
asked Norah.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, my child. I should be very lonesome
here alone with your estimable father.
I&#39;ll drop in to-morrow for Sunday
dinner; that is, if you are not going to
have company. I am glad that I met you,
Mr. Carrington.&quot;</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 474px;">
<img class="border" src="images/p0057-illus.png" width="474" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor old grandpa!&quot; sighed Norah,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
when the door closed upon him. &quot;He has
the ridiculous idea that he isn&#39;t wanted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nobody pursued the subject and Norah
began to preen herself.</p>

<p class="indent">An idea came to Carrington. He
wanted to be rid of his document. He
spoke to Kate, who nodded comprehensively.
She led him into the dining-room.
In one corner, protected by a low screen,
was a small safe. This she threw open,
and Carrington put the envelope into one
of the pigeon-holes. The safe was absolutely
empty, a fact which puzzled him
not a little.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We seldom use this,&quot; said the girl,
reading the vague unspoken question in
his eyes. &quot;The jewel safe is up-stairs in
my room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter in the least,&quot; he replied,
smiling, &quot;so long as I may safely
rid myself of these obnoxious papers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
And if you do not mind, I&#39;ll leave them
there till Monday morning. I&#39;ve thought
it all out, Kate. A man&#39;s only human,
after all. I could never prosecute the case
myself; I&#39;d be thinking of you and the
bread I have eaten. I&#39;ll turn the matter
over to Challoner, and let him do as he
thinks best. Of course, I shall be called
as a witness when the case comes up in
court, if it ever does.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She did not reply, but shut the door of
the safe and rose from her knees.</p>

<p class="indent">The south side of the dining-room was
made up of long colonial windows that
opened directly upon the lawn. They
were more like doors than windows. She
locked each one carefully and drew the
curtain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Norah is probably growing impatient
for us,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">With an indescribable impulse he suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
drew her into his arms and kissed
her. It might be the last he could ever
claim.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;John!&quot; she murmured, gently disengaging
herself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I love you,&quot; he said, &quot;and I could not
help it. Everything looks so dark.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The clock in the hall chimed the quarter
hour after eleven. Cavenaugh was in
his den. His desk was littered with sheets
of paper, upon which were formidable
columns of figures and dollar signs. He
sat back in his chair and listened. He
thought he heard a door or window close;
he wasn&#39;t certain. It was probably one of
the servants. He bit off the end of a fresh
cigar and resumed his work. Let the
young people play golf, if they wanted to,
and dance and frivol away the precious
hours; they would never know the joy of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
seeing one become two, two become four,
and so on, till the adding grew into the
ransoms of many kings. Ay, this was to
live. Oh, the beautiful numerals! Brigade
after brigade, corps after corps, they
marched at a sign from him; an army
greater than that of kings. To sit in a little
room, as in a puppet-booth, and juggle
the policies of the nations! Yes, Kate
should have a duke and Norah a prince;
he would show them all some day. Recollecting
Carrington, he frowned. Did the
fellow know anything, that he felt the
power to refuse an offer such as he had
made at the dinner-table? Bah! It would
be like crushing some insect. He determined
that this should be Carrington&#39;s
last visit. His pen moved once more, and
presently he became lost in his dreams
of calculation.</p>

<p class="indent">But Cavenaugh&#39;s ears had not deceived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
him, however, for he had heard the sound
of a closing window. A window had been
closed, but none of the servants had been
at hand.</p>

<p class="indent">At precisely eleven a man came swiftly
but cautiously across the lawn. When he
reached the long windows of the dining-room
he paused, but not irresolutely.
There was a sharp rasping sound, followed
by the uncertain glare that makes
the light of a dark-lantern separate and
individual, and a window swung noiselessly
inward. The room was in total
darkness. The man wore a short mask, a
soft felt hat well down over his eyes. He
cupped his hand to his ear and strained
to catch any sound. Silence. Then he
dropped behind the screen, consulted a
slip of paper by the light of his lantern,
and with a few quick turns of the combination-knob
opened the door of the safe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
He extracted the envelope and thrust it
into his pocket, without so much as a
glance at its contents. In making his exit,
the window stuck on the sill. In pressing
it the lock snapped loudly. This was the
sound Cavenaugh heard. The burglar ran
lightly across the lawn and disappeared
beyond the hedges. And none too soon.</p>

<p class="indent">The Cavenaugh drag rolled over the
hill and went clattering up to the porte-cochère.</p>

<p class="indent">On the way home Carrington, his mind
still wavering between this expedient and
that, decided that, after all, he would take
charge of the papers himself. It didn&#39;t
seem quite fair that Cavenaugh&#39;s safe
should protect his ultimate disgrace. So,
upon entering the house, he confided his
desire to Kate, who threw aside her wraps
and led him into the dining-room. She
had her own reasons for wishing the papers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
out of the safe. She turned on the
lights and swirled the combination-knob.
At this moment Norah came in.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you doing?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Carrington left some valuable papers
in the safe, and he wants them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Carrington wondered why Norah
gazed from him to her sister with so wild
an expression.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Papers?&quot; she murmured.</p>

<p class="indent">Kate opened the door. She sprang to
her feet in terror and dismay.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it?&quot; cried Carrington, who
saw by her expression that something extraordinary
had happened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They ... it is not there!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Norah sat down and hid her face on
her arms.</p>

<p class="indent">Carrington rushed over to the safe,
stooped and made a hasty examination.
It had been opened by some one who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
knew the combination! He stood up, a
cold chill wrinkling his spine. He saw
it all distinctly. Cavenaugh knew. He
had known all along. Cavenaugh had
overheard him speak to Kate, and had
opened the safe after their departure for
the club. It was all very cleverly done.
He knew that Kate was utterly blameless.
Then it dawned upon him that, they appeared
as though they accepted the catastrophe
as not wholly unexpected! To
what did this labyrinth lead?</p>

<p class="indent">A rattle of the curtain-rings wheeled
them about. They beheld Cavenaugh
himself standing in the doorway.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s the trouble?&quot; he asked, eying
Carrington suspiciously.</p>

<p class="indent">Carrington answered him icily. &quot;I left
some legal documents of great value in
this safe; they are no longer there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Cavenaugh&#39;s jaw dropped. He stared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
at Kate, then at Norah. If ever there was
written on a face unfeigned dismay and
astonishment, it was on the millionaire&#39;s.
A moment before Carrington would have
sworn that he was guilty; now he knew
not what to believe. He grew bewildered.
There had certainly been a burglar; but
who was he?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Carrington,&quot; said Cavenaugh,
pulling himself together with an effort,
&quot;you need have no worry whatever. I
will undertake to restore your documents.
I offer you no explanations.&quot; He left
them abruptly.</p>

<p class="indent">The young lawyer concluded to grope
no longer. Somebody else would have to
lead him out of this labyrinthine maze.
All at once there came to him a sense of
infinite relief. Providence had kindly
taken the matter out of his hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind, Kate,&quot; he said. &quot;For my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
part, I should be entirely satisfied if I
never saw the miserable thing again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father will find it for you.&quot; Her eyes
were dim with tears of shame.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it, girl?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing that I can explain to you,
John. Good night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When he had gone to his room, Norah
turned to her sister and sobbed on her
breast.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Kate!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is the matter, child?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I told grandpa the combination!&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span></p>

<p class="center">III</p>

<p>CARRINGTON tumbled out of
bed at six and threw out the old-fashioned
green blinds. A warm,
golden summer morning greeted his eyes,
and the peaceful calm of Sunday lay upon
the land. A robin piped in an apple-tree,
an oriole flashed across the flower-beds,
and a bee buzzed just outside the sill. A
brave day! He stepped into his tub,
bathed, and dressed in his riding-clothes,
for there was to be a canter down to the
sea and return before breakfast. From
the window he could see the groom walking
the beautiful thoroughbreds up and
down the driveway. There were only two
this morning; evidently Norah was not
going.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
The Cavenaugh girls had created almost
a scandal and a revolution when
they first appeared at Glenwood. People
had read and talked about women riding
like men, they had even seen pictures of
them, but to find them close at hand was
something of a shock. Yet, when they
saw with what ease the Cavenaugh girls
took the hedges, ditches and fences, how
their mounts never suffered from saddle-galls,
and, above all, how the two always
kept even pace with the best men riders,
opinion veered; and several ladies
changed their habits.</p>

<p class="indent">Norah, who saw the droll side of things,
once said that the accepted riding habit
for women reminded her of a kimono for
a harp.</p>

<p class="indent">Carrington stole gently down to the
horses. He had great affection for the
sleek thoroughbreds. Their ears went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
forward when they saw him, and they
whinnied softly. He rubbed their velvet
noses and in turn they nozzled him for
sugar-loaves. Had it not been for the
night and the attendant mysteries, his happiness
would have been complete. People
waste many precious moments in useless
retrospection; so Carrington resolutely
forced the subject from his mind. One
thing was certain, the Cavenaughs knew
who the burglar was; and there was something
strange in the idea of an empty safe
in a millionaire&#39;s home. Pshaw! He took
out the expected sugar-loaves and extended
them on both palms. The pair
lipped his hand and crunched the sweets
with evident relish.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How are they to-day, James?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fit for twenty miles, straight away or
&#39;cross-lots, sir. Your mount is feeling his
oats this morning; he hasn&#39;t been out for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
a run since Thursday, sir. I&#39;ve put the
curb on him in case he takes it into his
head to cut up shines. Here comes Miss
Kate, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Carrington&#39;s pulse rose. Kate was approaching
them. She was pale but serene.
She smiled a good morning, which took
in the gentleman and the groom.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope I haven&#39;t kept you waiting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not a moment; I only just got down
myself,&quot; said Carrington.</p>

<p class="indent">She mounted without assistance and adjusted
her skirts. The filly began to waltz,
impatient to be off.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To the beach?&quot; Carrington asked,
swinging into his saddle.</p>

<p class="indent">She nodded, and they started off toward
the highway at a smart trot. Once
there, the animals broke into an easy canter,
which they maintained for a mile or
more. Then Kate drew down to a walk.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
&quot;What a day!&quot; said he, waving his hand
toward the sea-line.</p>

<p class="indent">There was color a-plenty on her cheeks
now, and her eyes shone like precious
stones. There is no exhilaration quite like
it. She flicked the elders with her crop,
and once or twice reached up for a ripening
apple. In the air there was the strange
sea-smell, mingled with the warm scent of
clover.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll race you to the beach!&quot; she cried
suddenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Done! I&#39;ll give you to the sixth tree.&quot;
He laughed. There was really nothing at
all in the world but this beautiful girl,
the horses, and the white road that wound
in and out to the sea.</p>

<p class="indent">She trotted her mount to the sixth tree,
turned, and then gave the signal. Away
they went, the horses every bit as eager as
their riders. With their ears laid back,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
their nostrils wide, their feet drumming,
they thundered down the road. Carrington
gained, but slowly, and he had to hold
his right arm as a shield for his eyes, as
the filly&#39;s heels threw back a steady rain
of sand and gravel. Faster and faster; a
milk-wagon veered out just in time; foolish
chickens scampered to the wrong side
of the road, and the stray pigs in the orchards
squealed and bolted inland. It was
all very fine. And when they struck deep
tawny sand the animals were neck and
neck. It was now no easy task to bring
them to a stop. Carrington&#39;s hunter had
made up his mind to win, and the lithe
filly was equally determined. As an expedient,
they finally guided the animals
toward the hull of an ancient wreck;
nothing else would have stopped them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How I love it!&quot; said Kate breathlessly,
as she slid from the saddle. &quot;Beauty, you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
beat him, didn&#39;t you!&quot; patting the dripping
neck of her favorite.</p>

<p class="indent">They tethered the horses presently, and
sat down in the shade of the hull.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing like it, is there, girl?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hate automobiles,&quot; she answered irrelevantly.</p>

<p class="indent">The old, old sea quarreled murmurously
at their feet, and the white gulls
sailed hither and thither, sometimes
breasting the rollers just as they were
about to topple over into running creamy
foam. The man and the girl seemed perfectly
content to remain voiceless. There
was no sound but the song of the sea: the
girl dreamed, and the man wondered
what her dream was. Presently he
glanced at his watch. He stood up, brushing
the sand from his clothes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Half an hour between us and breakfast,
Kate. All aboard!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
The night before might have been only
an idle dream.</p>

<p class="indent">So they took the road back. Only the
sea and the gulls saw the tender kiss.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The pariah sauntered in at two o&#39;clock
that afternoon, just as the family were
sitting down to luncheon. He was a revelation.
There was nothing shabby about
him now. He wore a new suit, spats, a
new straw hat, and twirled a light bamboo.
There was something jaunty and
confident in his air, a bubbling in his eyes;
altogether, he was in fine fettle about
something. He cast aside his hat and cane
with a flourish.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aha! just in time,&quot; he said. &quot;Another
chair, William.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The butler sent a dubious glance at his
master; there was the usual curt nod and
the frown. So grandpa sat down beside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
Norah, whose usual effervescence had
strangely subsided; he pinched her cheek,
and deliberated between the cold ham and
chicken.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A fine day! A beautiful day! A day
of days!&quot; he cried, surrendering to the
appetitious lure of both meats.</p>

<p class="indent">Nobody replied to this outburst of exuberance;
nobody had the power to. A
strange calm settled over every one. This
was altogether a new kind of grandpa.
There was nothing timid or hesitant here,
nothing meek and humble; neither was
there that insufferable self-assurance and
arrogance of a disagreeable man. Grandpa&#39;s
attitude was simply that of an equal,
of a man of the world, of one who is confident
of the power he holds in reserve;
that was all. But for all that, he was a sensation
of some magnitude. Carrington
was seized with a wild desire to laugh.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
The truth came to him like an illumination;
but he wisely held his peace.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is something in the air to-day
that renews youth in old age; eh, my
son?&quot; with a sly wink at Cavenaugh.</p>

<p class="indent">Cavenaugh&#39;s expression of wonder began
to freeze and remained frozen to the
end of the meal. So all the honors of conversation
fell to grandpa, who seemed to
relish this new privilege.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father,&quot; said Cavenaugh, holding
back his accumulated wrath, &quot;I want to
see you in my study.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Immediately, my son. I was just about
to make that same request.&quot; Grandpa
looked at Kate, then at Carrington. &quot;I
suppose you young persons will invite
poor old grandpa to the wedding?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father!&quot; This was altogether too
much for patrician blood. Cavenaugh&#39;s
face reddened and his fists closed ominously.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
&quot;You will do me the honor, father,
not to meddle with my private
affairs. Kate is my daughter, and she shall
marry the man it pleases me to accept.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Carrington felt this cut dart over
grandpa&#39;s shoulder. He stirred uneasily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, if that&#39;s the way you look at it!&quot;
with a comical deprecatory shrug.
Grandpa touched Carrington on the arm.
&quot;Young man, do you love this girl? No
false modesty, now; the truth, and nothing
but the truth. Do you love her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;With all my heart!&quot; Carrington felt
the impulse occult. Something whispered
that his whole future depended upon his
answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you, Kate?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I love him, grandpa,&quot; bravely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s all I want to know,&quot; said
grandpa.</p>

<p class="indent">Cavenaugh released one of his fists; it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
fell upon the table and rattled things generally.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Am I in my own house?&quot; he bawled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That depends,&quot; answered grandpa
suavely. &quot;You&#39;ve got to behave yourself.
Now, then, let us repair to the secret
chamber of finance. It is the day of settlement,&quot;
grimly.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Cavenaugh was gently weeping.
The dread moment had come, come when
she had been lulled into the belief that it
would never come. Kate understood, and
longed to go to her and comfort her; and
she trembled for her father, who knew
nothing of the pit that lay at his feet.
Carrington dallied with his fork; he
wished he was anywhere in the world but
at the Cavenaugh table. The desire to
laugh recurred to him, but he realized
that the inclination was only hysterical.</p>

<p class="indent">Cavenaugh was already heading for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
study. He was in a fine rage. Grandpa
was close on his heels. At the threshold
he turned once more to Carrington.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know your <i>Tempest</i>, young man,
I&#39;m sure,&quot; he said. &quot;Well, this is the
revolt of Caliban&mdash;Caliban uplifted, as it
were.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The door closed behind them, and father
and son faced each other.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll trouble you for those papers you
took from the safe last night,&quot; said the
son heavily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, indeed!&quot; said grandpa.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At once; I have reached the limit of
my patience.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So have I,&quot; returned grandpa. &quot;Perhaps
you know what these papers are
about?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know nothing whatever, save that
they belong to Mr. Carrington. Hand
them over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
Grandpa helped himself to a cigar and
sat down. He puffed two or three times,
eyed the lighted end, and sighed with
satisfaction.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you but knew what they were about,
these papers, you would pay a cool million
for their possession. My word, it is
a droll situation; reads like the fourth act
in a play. If you have a duke picked out
for Kate, forget him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She will never marry Carrington!&quot;
Cavenaugh&#39;s voice rose in spite of his effort
to control it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My son, they will hear you,&quot; the pariah
warned. He blew a cloud of smoke
into the air and sniffed it. &quot;You never
offered me this particular brand,&quot; reproachfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Enjoy it,&quot; snapped the other, &quot;for it is
the last you will ever smoke in any house
of mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
&quot;You don&#39;t tell me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Those papers, instantly!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Be it known by these presents, et
cetera, et cetera,&#39;&quot; said the old man. He
rose suddenly, the banter leaving his lips
and eyes, and his jaw setting hard. &quot;You
had better get your check-book handy,
my son, for when I&#39;m through with you,
you&#39;ll be only too glad to fill out a blank
for fifty thousand. I consider myself
quite moderate. This young Carrington
is a mighty shrewd fellow; and I&#39;d rather
have him as a friend than an enemy. He
has made out his case so strongly that it
will cost you a pretty penny to escape with
a whole skin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The case of the people versus Cavenaugh
et al. It concerns the clever way
in which you and your partners slid under
the seven per cent. dividend due your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
investors; which caused a slump in the
price of the shares, forcing thousands to
sell their stock; which you bought back
at a handsome profit. Moloch! The millions
you have are not enough; you must
have more. There are about twelve of
you in all, not one of you worth less than
three millions. What a beautiful chance
for blackmail!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Cavenaugh stepped back, and his legs,
striking a chair, toppled him into it. His
father had become Medusa&#39;s head!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aha! That jars you some,&quot; chuckled
grandpa.</p>

<p class="indent">It took Cavenaugh some time to recover
his voice, and when he did it was faint
and unnatural.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is this true?&quot; he gasped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is so true that I&#39;ll trouble you for
the check now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, father, this is no time for nonsense.&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
Cavenaugh waved his hand impatiently.
&quot;Let me see the document.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hardly. But the moment you place
the check in my hands, I shall be pleased
to do so. But there must be no reservation
to have payment stopped.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will not give you a single penny!&quot;
The mere suggestion of giving up so
large a sum without a struggle seemed
preposterous. &quot;Not a penny! And furthermore,
I am through with you for
good and all. Shift for yourself hereafter.
Fifty thousand! You make me
laugh!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall make you laugh, my son; but
not on the humorous side.&quot; The old man
reached out his hand and struck the bell.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you want?&quot; asked Cavenaugh,
mystified.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want the author of the document. I
propose to take the family skeleton out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
the closet and dangle it up and down before
the young man&#39;s eyes. You will
laugh, I dare say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Cavenaugh fell back in his chair again.
The door opened and William looked in.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You rang, sir?&quot; to Cavenaugh <i>fils</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, William,&quot; said Cavenaugh <i>père</i>
affably; &quot;I rang. Call Mr. Carrington.&quot;
The butler disappeared. &quot;It is my turn,
Henry, and I have waited a long time, as
you very well know. Ha! Sit down, Mr.
Carrington, sit down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Carrington, who had entered, obeyed
readily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You left some papers in the dining-room
safe last night,&quot; began grandpa.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was about to ask you to return them,&quot;
replied Carrington, with assumed pleasantry.</p>

<p class="indent">The two Cavenaughs looked at each
other blankly. Finally grandpa laughed.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 463px;">
<img class="border" src="images/p0086-illus.png" width="463" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
&quot;I told you he was clever!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is true, then,&quot; snarled the millionaire,
&quot;that you have been meddling with
affairs that in no wise concern you. I
warn you that your case in court will not
have a leg to stand on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I prefer not to discuss the merits of the
case,&quot; said Carrington quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have been your host, sir; you have
eaten at my table.&quot; Cavenaugh, as he
spoke, was not without a certain dignity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All of which, recognizing the present
situation, I profoundly regret.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good!&quot; said grandpa. &quot;Henry, if you
had been the general they give you credit
for, you would have offered Mr. Carrington
that seventeen thousand two or three
years ago. There is nothing so menacing
to dishonesty as the free lance. Now, listen
to me for a space. We&#39;ll come to the
documentary evidence all in good time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
I spoke of Caliban uplifted,&quot; ironically.
&quot;For years I have been treated as a pariah,
as a beast of burden, as a messenger
boy, as a go-between to take tricks that
might have soiled my son&#39;s delicate hands.
Father and son, yes; but in name only.
Blood is thicker than water only when
riches and ambition are not touched in
the quick. This dutiful son of mine could
easily have elevated me along with himself;
but he would not do so. He was
afraid that people might learn something
of my past, which would greatly hinder
his advancement. He prospered, he grew
rich and arrogant; he put his heel on my
neck, and I dared not revolt. You
wouldn&#39;t believe it, would you, Mr. Carrington,
that I was graduated with honors
from Oxford University. I speak
three tongues fluently, and have a smattering
of a dozen others; am a doctor of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
philosophy, an Egyptologist. But I was
indolent and loved good times, and so, you
see, it came about that I fell into evil
ways. Formerly, I was a burglar by profession.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He stopped, eying Carrington&#39;s stupefaction.
The son gnawed his lips impotently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was a master, after a fashion,&quot; resumed
the old man, satisfied with his
dénouement. &quot;I committed a dozen splendid
burglaries. I never left a trail behind.
The police sought for me, but did
not know me either by name or by sight.
This was the sword my son kept over my
neck. The slightest rebellion, and he
threatened to expose me. Oh, I know the
boy well enough; he would have done it
in those days. Once extradited to England,
thirty years ago, no one would have
connected our names. Yet he was afraid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
of me; he wasn&#39;t sure that at any time the
old desire would spring up renewed. I
robbed to gratify my craving for excitement
rather than to fill my purse. I made
an unhappy marriage; something Kate
nor Norah shall do while I live. Henry
was clever. He made me an allowance of
two hundred a month. And how do you
suppose he arranged the payment? On
the first day of the month he placed the
cash in a safe in the house, and changed
the combination. If I got the money without
being caught it was mine; otherwise
I went hungry. Ingenious idea, wasn&#39;t
it? For I had all the excitement, and none
of the peril of a real burglary. Henry
forgot, yesterday, that it was the first of
the month.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The millionaire found it impossible to
remain seated. He rose and paced the
floor, his brows knit, his hands clenched.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
He was at bay. Carrington felt as if he
were in the midst of some mad dream.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sometimes I succeeded in opening
the safe; and sometimes, when luck went
against me for two or three months,
Norah tipped me the combination. She
dared not do it too often. So the months
went on. Once a month I was permitted
to visit my grandchildren. My son grew
richer and richer; for myself, I remained
in the valley of humiliation. I
had no chance. I had never met any of
my son&#39;s friends; he took good care that
I did not; so they were in total darkness
as to my existence. But the ball and chain
were knocked off last night. Your papers
are, after all, only an incident. Caliban
revolts. Mr. Carrington, my son! Oh, I
am proud of him. I believed the genius
for robbery was mine. I am a veritable
tyro beside Henry. Half a dozen millions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
from the pockets of the poor at one
fell swoop! Where&#39;s your Robin Hood
and his ilk? But it isn&#39;t called robbery; it
is called high finance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He applied a match to his dead cigar
and thoughtfully eyed his son.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And there is a good joke on me, weaving
in and out of all this. I regularly invested
half my allowance in buying
shares in my son&#39;s company, to insure my
old age. It jarred me when I read the
truth last night. I hate to be outwitted.
Henry, sit down; you make me nervous.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, what are you going to do?&quot;
asked the son. As he faced his father
there was something lion-like in his expression.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sit down, my son, and I will tell you,&quot;
answered the old man quietly. He knew
that his son was a fighter, and that to win
he would have to strike quick and hard.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
Cavenaugh flung himself into his chair.
At that moment he did not know which
he hated the most, his father or Carrington.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;First, you will write out that check
for fifty thousand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blackmail!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing of the sort. For twenty years
you have kept your heel on my neck. I
could do nothing; opportunities came
and I dared not grasp them; my genuine
ability was allowed to rust. It is simply
compensation. Blackmail? I think not.
I could easily force a million from you.
But I am and have been for years an
honest man. And heaven knows how well
I have paid for my early transgression,&quot;
bitterly. &quot;This hour is mine, and I propose
to use it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What guaranty have I of your good
faith?&quot; fiercely.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
&quot;My word,&quot; calmly. &quot;I have never yet
broken it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Carrington gazed longingly toward the
door. It was horribly embarrassing. He
began to realize that Kate&#39;s father would
hate him bitterly indeed, and that his own
happiness looked very remote.</p>

<p class="indent">Cavenaugh turned to his desk, filled
out the blank, and passed it to his father,
who, with scarcely a glance at it, passed it
back with a negative shake of the head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The official certifying stamp lies on
your desk; use it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was no getting around this keen-eyed
old man. He knew every point in
the game.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will live to regret this,&quot; said
Cavenaugh, his eyes sparkling with
venom.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have many things to regret; principally
that fate made me a father.&quot; The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
old man passed the check over to Carrington.
&quot;You&#39;re a lawyer; does that look
legal to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Carrington signified that it did.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, then, Henry, you will write
down on official paper your resignation
as president and director of the General
Trust Company of America. You will
give orders for the restitution of the millions
that were fraudulently added to
your capital. I am not the least interested
in what manner the restitutions are made,
so long as they are made. I am now representing
the investors. As for your partners,
it will be easy for you to impress
them with the necessity of the action.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And if I refuse?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing less than the attorney-general.
I intend to make this business as
complete as possible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Cavenaugh turned again to his desk.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
He knew his father even as his father
knew him. He wrote hurriedly, the pen
sputtering angrily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What else?&quot; with a cold fury.</p>

<p class="indent">Again the old man gave Carrington
the paper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is perfectly intelligible,&quot; he said.
He began to feel a bit sorry for Cavenaugh
junior.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, those papers,&quot; said Cavenaugh
sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe they belong to me,&quot; interposed
Carrington.</p>

<p class="indent">Grandpa smiled. &quot;It all depends.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I could easily force you,&quot; suggestively.</p>

<p class="indent">Grandpa smiled again. &quot;Of that I
haven&#39;t the least doubt. Of course, what
I have is only a copy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is the only copy in existence,&quot; replied
Carrington anxiously. And then a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
flush of shame mantled his cheeks.
Where was his legal cunning?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; The ejaculation came from
Cavenaugh junior.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is but one thing more,&quot; said
grandpa urbanely. &quot;I am determined
that Kate shall be happy. She shall marry
Mr. Carrington before the snow flies.
It is an excellent policy to keep valuable
secrets in the family.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Give your papers to the attorney-general.
I&#39;ll see you all hanged before
I&#39;ll give my consent!&quot; Cavenaugh roared
out these words. His patience had truly
reached the limit of endurance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Softly, softly!&quot; murmured grandpa.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean it!&quot; <i>con agitata</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, well; what will be, will be. Son,
I came down here yesterday with altogether
a different piece of business in
mind. The documents I discovered last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
night changed these plans. You own
rich oil lands in Texas; or, rather, you
did own them before you sold out to the
company. The land you sold was not,
and never had been, legally yours; you
owned not a single tuft of grass. Government
land-grab, I believe they call it. It
is not now a question of refunding money;
it is a question of avoiding prison. The
supreme court at Washington can not be
purchased. It cost me five hundred,
which I could ill afford, to get a copy of
the original transfer. The real owner mistook
me for you, son; that is how I
learned. Your consent to this marriage;
or, my word for it, I&#39;ll put you where you
would have put me, had you dared.
Quick! My patience is quite as tense as
yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The collapse of Cavenaugh was total.
He saw the futility of further struggle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
Ah! and he had believed all these transgressions
securely hidden and forgotten,
that the fortress of his millions would
protect him from all attack. Too late he
realized that he had gone too far with
his father. There was no mercy in the old
man&#39;s eyes, and Cavenaugh knew in his
heart that he deserved none.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very sensible,&quot; said the retired burglar.
He folded the check and put it in
his wallet, while his son covered his face
with his hands. &quot;Murder will out, even
among the most pious. I know that what
has passed between us will be forgotten
by Mr. Carrington. For myself, I shall
return to England. I have always had a
horror of dying in this country. Like
father, like son; the parable reads truly.
It was in the blood, Mr. Carrington; it
was in the blood. But Henry here went
about it in a more genteel manner.&quot; He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
struck the bell. &quot;William, send Miss
Kate here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">William bowed. He recognized the
change; grandpa&#39;s voice was full of confident
authority.</p>

<p class="indent">Kate entered the study shortly after.
She had been weeping; her eyes were red.
Seeing her father&#39;s bowed head, she
sprang to his side like a lioness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What have they been doing to you,
father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing but what is just,&quot; softly answered
her parent. The little dukes and
princes faded away as a dream fades.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Grandpa ...&quot; she began.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Child, it is all settled. The hatchet is
buried in frozen ground. Your father
consents to your marriage with Mr. Carrington.
It has been a heated argument,
but he has come around to my way of
thinking. &#39;All&#39;s right with the world,&#39; as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
Browning says. Bless you, my children,
bless you!&quot; with tender irony.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now, my papers,&quot; said Carrington,
smiling up at the girl reassuringly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you still wish to marry me?&quot;
asked the girl, her face burning and her
eyes moist.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d marry you if your grandpa was
Beelzebub himself!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here&#39;s your papers, young man,&quot; said
grandpa. He passed the envelope across
the table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; cried Carrington.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It means, my boy,&quot; said grandpa,
&quot;that blood is thicker than water, and
that I really intended no harm to Henry.
And then, besides, I like to win when all
the odds are against me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Carrington gently turned the envelope
upside down. Nothing but burnt paper
fluttered upon the table.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span></p>

<h2>TWO CANDIDATES</h2>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p>TO begin with, I am going to call
things by their real names. At
first glance this statement will
give you a shiver of terror, that is, if you
happen to be a maiden lady or a gentleman
with reversible cuffs. But your shivers
will be without reason. Prue may
read, and modest Prue&#39;s mama; for it isn&#39;t
going to be a naughty story; on the contrary,
grandma&#39;s spring medicines are
less harmless. Yet there is a parable to
expound and a moral to point out; but I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
shall leave these to your own discernment.</p>

<p class="indent">It has always appealed to me as rather
a silly custom on a story-teller&#39;s part to
invent names for the two great political
parties of the United States; and for my
part, I am going to call a Democrat a
Democrat and a Republican a Republican,
because these titles are not so hallowed
in our time as to be disguised in
print and uttered in a bated breath.
There is fortunately no <i>lèse-majesté</i> in
America.</p>

<p class="indent">Men inclined toward the evil side of
power will be found in all parties, and
always have been. Unlike society, the
middle class in politics usually contains
all the evil elements. In politics the citizen
becomes the lowest order, and the
statesman the highest; and, thanks to the
common sense of the race, these are largely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
honest and incorruptible. When these
become disintegrated, a republic falls.</p>

<p class="indent">Being a journalist and a philosopher, I
look upon both parties with tolerant contempt.
The very nearness of some things
disillusions us; and I have found that
only one illusion remains to the newspaper
man, and that is that some day he&#39;ll
get out of the newspaper business. I vote
as I please, though the family does not
know this. The mother is a Republican
and so is the grandmother; and, loving
peace in the house, I dub myself a Republican
till that moment when I enter the
voting-booth. Then I become an individual
who votes as his common-sense
directs.</p>

<p class="indent">The influence of woman in politics is
no inconsiderable matter. The great
statesman may flatter himself that his
greatness is due to his oratorical powers;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
but his destiny is often decided at the
breakfast-table. Why four-fifths of the
women lean toward Republicanism is
something no mere historian can analyze.</p>

<p class="indent">In my town politics had an evil odor.
For six years a Democrat had been mayor,
and for six years the town had been plundered.
For six years the Republicans had
striven, with might and main, to regain
the power ... and the right to
plunder. It did not matter which party
ruled, graft (let us omit the quotation
marks) was the tocsin. The citizens were
robbed, openly or covertly, according to
the policy of the party in office. There
was no independent paper in town; so,
from one month&#39;s end to another it was
leaded editorial vituperation. Then Caliban
revolted. An independent party was
about to be formed.</p>

<p class="indent">The two bosses, however, were equal to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
the occasion. They immediately hustled
around and secured as candidates for the
mayoralty two prominent young men
whose honesty and integrity were unimpeachable.
Caliban, as is his habit,
sheathed his sword and went back to his
bench, his desk, or whatever his occupation
was.</p>

<p class="indent">On the Republican side they nominated
a rich young club-man. Now, as you will
readily agree, it is always written large
on the political banner that a man who is
rich has no incentive to become a grafter.
The public is ever willing to trust its
funds to a millionaire. The Democrats,
with equal cunning, brought forward a
brilliant young attorney, whose income
was rather moderate but whose ability
and promise were great. The Democratic
organs hailed his nomination with delight.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
&quot;We want one of the people to represent
us, not one of the privileged class.&quot;
You see, there happened to be no rich
young Democrat available.</p>

<p class="indent">These two candidates were close personal
friends. They had been chums from
boyhood and had been graduated from
the same college. They belonged to the
same clubs, and were acknowledged to be
the best horsemen in town. As to social
prominence, neither had any advantage
over the other, save in the eyes of matrons
who possessed marriageable (and extravagant)
daughters. Williard, the Republican
nominee, was a handsome chap,
liberal-minded and generous-hearted,
without a personal enemy in the world. I
recollect only one fault: he loved the
world a little too well. The opposition
organs, during the heat of the campaign,
dropped vague hints regarding dinners to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
singers and actresses and large stakes in
poker games. Newcomb, his opponent,
was not handsome, but he had a fine,
clean-cut, manly face, an intrepid eye, a
resolute mouth, and a tremendous ambition.
He lived well within his income,
the highest recommendation that may be
paid to a young man of these days.</p>

<p class="indent">He threw himself into the fight with
all the ardor of which his nature was capable;
whereas Williard was content to
let the machine direct his movements.
The truth is, Williard was indifferent
whether he became mayor or not. To
him the conflict was a diversion, a new
fish to Lucullus; and when the Democratic
organs wrote scathing editorials
about what they termed his profligate career,
he would laugh and exhibit the
articles at the club. It was all a huge
joke. He made very few speeches, and at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
no time could he be forced into the foreign
districts. He complained that his
olfactory nerve was too delicately educated.
The leaders swallowed their rancor;
there was nothing else for them to
do. In Williard&#39;s very lack of ambition
lay his strength. Poverty would have
made a great man out of him; but riches
have a peculiar way of numbing the appreciation
of the greater and simpler
things in life.</p>

<p class="indent">Newcomb went everywhere; the Poles
hurrahed for him, the Germans, the Irish,
the Huns and the Italians. And he made
no promises which he did not honestly intend
to fulfil. To him the fight meant
everything; it meant fame and honor, a
comfortable addition to his income, and
Washington as a finality. He would purify
the Democrats while he annihilated
the pretensions of the Republicans. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
was what historians call an active
dreamer, a man who dreams and then
goes forth to accomplish things. His personality
was engaging.</p>

<p class="indent">Besides all this (for the secret must be
told) Newcomb was in love and wished
to have all these things to lay at the feet
of his beloved, even if she returned them.
You will regularly find it to be true that
the single man is far more ambitious than
his married brother. The latter invariably
turns over the contract to his wife.</p>

<p class="indent">Williard was deeply in love, too, with
Senator Gordon&#39;s lovely daughter, and
Senator Gordon was that mysterious
power which directed the Republican
forces in his section of the state. So you
may readily believe that Newcomb was
forced to put up a better fight than Williard,
who stood high in Senator Gordon&#39;s
favor. The girl and the two young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
men had been friends since childhood,
and nobody knew whether she cared for
either of them in the way they desired.
Everybody in town, who was anybody,
understood the situation; and everybody
felt confident that Williard was most
likely to win. The girl never said anything,
even to her intimate friends; but
when the subject was brought up, she
smiled in a way that dismissed it.</p>

<p class="indent">Such was the political situation at the
beginning of the municipal campaign.
There have been like situations in any
number of cities which boast of one hundred
thousand inhabitants or more; perhaps
in your town, and yours, and yours.
That bugaboo of the politician, reform,
brings around this phenomenon about
once in every eight years. For a while the
wicked ones promise to be good, and you
will admit that that helps.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
It was amusing to follow the newspapers.
They vilified each other, ripped to
shreds the character of each candidate,
recalled boyhood escapades and magnified
them into frightful crimes, and declared
in turn that the opposition boss
should land in the penitentiary if it took
all the type in the composing-rooms to
do it. What always strikes me as odd is
that, laughter-loving people that we are,
nobody laughs during these foolish periods.
Instead, everybody goes about,
straining his conscience and warping his
common-sense into believing these flimsy
campaign lies, these outrageous political
roorbacks.</p>

<p class="indent">When Williard and Newcomb met at
the club, at the Saturday-night luncheons,
they avoided each other tactfully, each
secretly longing to grasp the other&#39;s hand
and say: &quot;Don&#39;t believe a word of it, old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
boy; it&#39;s all tommy-rot.&quot; But policy held
them at arm&#39;s length. What would the
voters say if they heard that their respective
candidates were hobnobbing at a private
club? Newcomb played billiards
in the basement while Williard played a
rubber at whist up stairs; and the Saturday
rides out to the country club became
obsolete. Only a few cynics saw the droll
side of the situation; and they were confident
that when the election was over the
friendship would be renewed all the more
strongly for the tension.</p>

<p class="indent">One night, some weeks before the election,
Williard dined alone with the senator
at the Gordon home. Betty Gordon
was dining elsewhere. With the cognac
and cigars, the senator drew out a slip of
paper, scrutinized it for a space, then
handed it to his protégé.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s the slate. How do you like it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
Williard ran his glance up and down
the columns. Once he frowned.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; asked the senator
shrewdly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not like the idea of Matthews for
commissioner of public works. He&#39;s a
blackleg&mdash;there&#39;s no getting around that.
He practically runs that faro-bank above
his down-town saloon. Can&#39;t you put
some one else in his place?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The senator flipped the ash from the
end of his cigar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Honestly, my boy, I agree with your
objection; but the word is given, and if
we turn him down now, your friend Newcomb
will stand a pretty fair show of being
the next mayor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You might get a worse one,&quot; Williard
laughed. &quot;Jack is one of the finest fellows
in the world,&quot; loyally.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not a bit of doubt; but politically,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
said the senator, laughing, &quot;he is a rascal,
a man without a particle of character,
and all that. But personally speaking, I
would that this town had more like him.
Win or lose, he will always be welcome in
this house. But this Matthews matter;
you will have to swallow him or be swallowed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s a rascal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps he is. Once you are elected,
however, you can force him out, and be
hanged to him. Just now it would be extremely
dangerous. My boy, politics has
strange bed-fellows, as the saying goes.
These men are necessary; to fight them is
to cut your own throat. No one knows
just how they get their power; but one
morning you will wake up and find them
menacing you, and you have to placate
them and toss them sops.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I might at least have been consulted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
&quot;I appreciated your antagonism beforehand.
Politics is a peculiar business.
A man must form about himself a shell
as thick as a turtle&#39;s, or his feelings are
going to be hurt. Now, if you would like
to change any of these smaller offices, the
health department doesn&#39;t matter. What
do you say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, if Matthews remains on the slate,
I do not care to alter the rest of it. But
I warn you that I shall get rid of him at
the earliest opportunity.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just as you like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The senator smiled covertly. Matthews
was one of his henchmen in the larger
matters of state. His name had been the
first to appear on the slate, and the senator
was determined that it should remain
there. Not that he had any liking for the
man; simply he was one of the wheels
which made the machine run smoothly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
The senator knew his power of persuasion;
he knew Williard&#39;s easy-going
nature; but he also knew that these easy-going
persons are terribly stubborn at
times. He was obliged to hold on to
Matthews. The gubernatorial campaign
was looming up for the ensuing year, and
the senator was curious to learn the real
power that went with the seal of a governor
of a first-class state.</p>

<p class="indent">There fell an intermission to the conversation.
Williard smoked thoughtfully.
He recalled the years during which he
had accepted the generous hospitality of
this house, and the love he held for the
host&#39;s daughter. Only since his return
from abroad had he learned the strength
of his sentiment. Heretofore he had
looked upon the girl as a sister, jolly, talented,
a fine dancer, a daring rider, a
good comrade. He had been out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
country for three years. On his return he
had found Betty Gordon a beautiful
woman, and he had silently surrendered.
As yet he had said nothing, but he knew
that she knew. Yet he always saw the
shadow of Newcomb, old Jack Newcomb.
Well, let the best man win!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can find a way to dispose of Matthews,&quot;
he said finally.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I dare say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Williard did not know the tenacity
with which some men cling to office. The
senator did.</p>

<p class="indent">Here the servant ushered in two lieutenants
of the senator&#39;s. One was an ex-consul
and the other was the surveyor of
customs, who was not supposed to dabble
in local politics.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Everything is agreeable to Mr. Williard,&quot;
the senator answered in reply to
the questioning look of his subordinates.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
&quot;He vows, however, that he will shake
Matthews as soon as he can get the
chance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The new arrivals laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ll put you through, young man,&quot;
said the ex-consul; &quot;and one of these fine
days we shall send you to France. That&#39;s
the place for a man of your wit and
wealth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Williard smiled and lighted a fresh
cigar. He did possess the reputation of
being a clever wit, and in his secret heart
he would much prefer a consulate or a
secretaryship at the French embassy. He
thoroughly detested this indiscriminate
hand-shaking which went with local politics.</p>

<p class="indent">But Matthews stuck in his gorge, and
he wondered if Newcomb was going
through any like ordeal, and if Newcomb
would submit so readily.... Why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
the deuce didn&#39;t Betty return? It was almost
nine o&#39;clock.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently her sunny countenance appeared
in the doorway, and Williard
dropped his cigar joyfully and rose. It
was worth all the politics in the world!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gentlemen, you will excuse me,&quot; he
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go along!&quot; the senator cried jovially.
&quot;We can spare you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As indeed they very well could!</p>

<p class="indent">In a minute Williard was in the music-room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I really do not know that I ought to
shake hands with you, Dick,&quot; began Betty,
tossing her hat on the piano. &quot;You
have deceived me for years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Deceived you! What do you mean?&quot;
mightily disturbed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wait a moment.&quot; She brought forth a
paper. &quot;Sit down in front of me. This is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
going to be a court of inquiry, and your
sins shall be passed in review.&quot; He
obeyed meekly. &quot;Now listen,&quot; the girl
went on, mischief in her eyes; &quot;this paper
says horrid things about you. It claims
that you have given riotous dinners to
actresses and comic-opera singers. I classify
them because I do not think comic-opera
singers are actresses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rot!&quot; said Williard, crossing his legs
and eying with pleasure the contours of
her face. &quot;Jolly rot!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mustn&#39;t say &#39;jolly&#39; in this country;
it&#39;s English, and they&#39;ll be accusing
you of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, bally rot; how will that go?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That isn&#39;t very pretty, but it will pass.
Now, to proceed. They say that your private
life is profligate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, come now, Betty!&quot; laughing diffidently.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
&quot;They say that you gamble at poker
and win and lose huge sums.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your father plays poker in Washington;
I&#39;ve seen him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s not on trial; <i>you</i> are. Furthermore,&quot;
went on the girl, the twinkle going
from her eye, leaving it searching yet unfathomable,
&quot;this editor says that you are
only a dummy in this game of politics,
and that once you are mayor, your signature
will be all that will be required of
you. That is to say, you will be nothing
but a puppet in the hands of the men
who brought about your election.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Williard thought of Matthews, and the
smile on his lips died.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, Dick, this paper says that it
seeks only the truth of things, and admits
that you possess certain engaging qualities.
What am I to believe?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Betty, you know very well that they&#39;ll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
have me robbing widows before election.&quot;
He was growing restless. He felt
that this trial wasn&#39;t all play. &quot;If you
don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d rather talk of something
else. Politics, politics, morning, noon and
night until my ears ache!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Or burn,&quot; suggested the girl. &quot;The
things they say about your private life&mdash;I
don&#39;t care for them. I know that they are
not truths. But the word &#39;puppet&#39; annoys
me.&quot; She laid aside the paper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have I ever acted like a dummy, Betty?
In justice to me, have I?&quot; He was
serious.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not in ordinary things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No one has ever heard that I broke a
promise.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Or that I was cowardly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, if I am elected, I shall fool certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
persons. I am easy-going; I confess
to that impeachment; but I have never
been crossed successfully.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They&#39;ll know how to accomplish their
ends without crossing you. That&#39;s a part
of the politician&#39;s business.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I am elected, I&#39;ll study ways and
means. Hang it, I wasn&#39;t running after
office. They said that they needed me. As
a property owner I had to surrender. I
am not a hypocrite; I never was. I can&#39;t
go honestly among the lower classes and
tell them that I like them, shake their
grimy hands, hobnob with them at caucuses
and in gloomy halls. I am not a politician;
my father was not before me; it
isn&#39;t in my blood. I haven&#39;t the necessary
ambition. Newcomb&#39;s grandfather was
a war governor; mine was a planter in
the South. Now, Newcomb has ambition
enough to carry him to the presidency;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
and I hope he&#39;ll get it some day,
and make an ambassador out of me.
Sometimes I wish I wasn&#39;t rich, so that I
might enjoy life as some persons do. To
have something to fight for constantly! I
am spoiled.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He wheeled his chair toward the fire
and rested his elbows on his knees.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s very handsome,&quot; thought the
girl; but she sighed.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span></p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p>THAT same evening Newcomb
and McDermott, the Democratic
leader, met by appointment in
McDermott&#39;s law offices. McDermott
was a wealthy steel-manufacturer who
had held various state and national offices.
As a business man his policy
was absolute honesty. He gave liberal
wages, met his men personally, and adjusted
their differences. There were as
many Republicans as Democrats in his
employ. Politics never entered the shop.
Every dollar in his business had been
honestly earned. He was a born leader,
kindly, humorous, intelligent. But once
he put on his silk hat and frock coat,
a metamorphosis, strange and incomprehensible,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
took place. He became altogether
a different man; cold, purposeful,
determined, bitter, tumbling over obstacles
without heart or conscience, using all
means to gain his devious ends; scheming,
plotting, undermining this man or elevating
that, a politician in every sense of the
word; cunning, astute, long-headed, far-seeing.
He was not suave like his old
enemy, the senator; he was blunt because
he knew the fullness of his power. But
for all his bluntness, he was, when need
said must, a diplomat of no mean order.
If he brought about a shady election, he
had the courage to stand by what he had
done. He was respected and detested
alike.</p>

<p class="indent">The present incumbent in the city hall
was no longer of use to him. He was wise
enough to see that harm to his power
would come about in case the reform
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
movement got headway; he might even
be dethroned. So his general&#39;s eye had
lighted on Newcomb, as the senator&#39;s had
lighted on Williard; only he had mistaken
his man, whereas the senator had
not.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My boy,&quot; he began, &quot;I&#39;m going to
lecture you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go ahead,&quot; said Newcomb. &quot;I know
what the trouble is. I crossed out Mr.
Murphy&#39;s name from the list you fixed
up for my inspection.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And his name must go back,&quot; smiling.
&quot;We can&#39;t afford to turn him down
at this late day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can,&quot; said the protégé imperturbably
and firmly.</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment their glances met and
clashed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must always remember the welfare
of the party,&quot; gently.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
&quot;And the people,&quot; supplemented the
admonished one.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course,&quot; with thin lips. &quot;But
Murphy&#39;s name must stand. We depend
upon the eighth ward to elect you, and
Murphy holds it in his palm. Your
friend Williard will be forced to accept
Matthews for the same reason. It&#39;s a
game of chess, but a great game.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Matthews? I don&#39;t believe it. Williard
would not speak to him on the street,
let alone put him on the ticket.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wait and see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s a blackleg, a gambler, worse
than Murphy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what is your grievance against
Murphy? He has always served the party
well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not to speak of Mr. Murphy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What has he done?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He has sold his vote three times in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
common council. He sold it once for two
thousand dollars in that last pavement
deal. I have been rather observant. Let
him remain alderman; I can not see my
way clear to appoint him to a position in
the city hall.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">McDermott&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;Your
accusations are grave. If Murphy learns,
he may make you prove it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Newcomb remained silent for a few
minutes, his face in thoughtful repose;
then having decided to pursue a certain
course, he reached into a pigeon-hole of
his desk and selected a paper which he
gave to McDermott. The latter studied
the paper carefully. From the paper his
glance traveled to the face of the young
man opposite him. He wondered why he
hadn&#39;t taken more particular notice of the
cleft chin and the blue-gray eyes. Had he
made a mistake? Was the young fellow&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
honesty greater than his ambition? McDermott
returned the paper without comment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that proof enough?&quot; Newcomb
asked, a bit of raillery in his tones.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You should have told me of this long
ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hadn&#39;t the remotest idea that Murphy&#39;s
name would turn up. You can very
well understand that I can not consider
this man&#39;s name as an appointee.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why hasn&#39;t it been turned over to the
district attorney?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The plaintiff is a patient man. He
left it to me. It is a good sword, and I
may have to hold it over Mr. Murphy&#39;s
neck.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">McDermott smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Democratic party in this county
needs a strong tonic in the nature of a
clean bill. I want my appointees men of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
high standing; I want them honest; I
want them not for what they have done,
but what they may do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">McDermott smiled again. &quot;I have
made a mistake in not coming to you
earlier. There is a great future for a man
of your kidney, Newcomb. You have a
genuine talent for politics. You possess
something that only a dozen men in a
hundred thousand possess, a tone. Words
are empty things unless they are backed
by a tone. Tone holds the auditor, convinces
him, directs him if by chance he is
wavering. You are a born orator. Miller
retires from Congress next year. His usefulness
in Washington has passed. How
would you like to succeed him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Insidious honey! Newcomb looked out
of the window. Washington! A seat
among the Seats of the Mighty! A torchlight
procession was passing through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
street below, and the noise of the fife and
drum rose. The world&#39;s applause; the
beating of hands, the yells of triumph, the
laudation of the press&mdash;the world holds
no greater thrill than this. Art and literature
stand pale beside it. But a worm
gnawed at the heart of this rose, a canker
ate into the laurel. Newcomb turned.
He was by no means guileless.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When I accepted this nomination, I
did so because I believed that the party
was in danger, and that, if elected, I
might benefit the people. I have remained
silent; I have spoken but little of
my plans; I have made few promises.
Mr. McDermott, I am determined, first
and foremost, to be mayor in all the meaning
of the word. I refuse to be a figure-head.
I have crossed out Murphy&#39;s name
because he is a dishonest citizen. Yes, I
am ambitious; but I would forego Washington
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
rather than reach it by shaking
Murphy&#39;s hand.&quot; The blood of the old
war-governor tingled in his veins at that
moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It must be replaced,&quot; quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In face of that document?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In spite of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I refuse!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Listen to reason, my boy; you are
young, and you have to learn that in politics
there&#39;s always a bitter pill with the
sweet. To elect you I have given my word
to Murphy that he shall have the office.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You may send Mr. Murphy to me,&quot;
said Newcomb curtly. &quot;I&#39;ll take all the
blame.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is final?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is. And I am surprised that you
should request this of me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He will defeat you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So be it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
McDermott was exceedingly angry,
but he could not help admiring the young
man&#39;s resoluteness and direct honesty.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are making a fatal mistake. I
shall make an enemy of the man, and I
shall not be able to help you. I have a
great deal at stake. If we lose the eighth,
we lose everything, and for years to
come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps. One dishonest step leads to
another, and if I should sanction this man,
I should not hesitate at greater dishonesty.
My honesty is my bread and butter
... and my conscience.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Corporations have no souls; politics
has no conscience. Williard ...&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My name is Newcomb,&quot; abruptly.
&quot;In a matter of this kind I can not permit
myself to be subjected to comparisons.
You brought about my present position in
municipal affairs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
&quot;We had need of you, and still need
you,&quot; confessed the other reluctantly.
&quot;The party needs new blood.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are a clever man, Mr. McDermott;
you are a leader; let me appeal to
your better judgment. Murphy is a
blackguard, and he would be in any party,
in any country. In forcing him on me,
you rob me of my self-respect.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">McDermott shrugged. &quot;In this case he
is a necessary evil. The success of the
party depends upon his good will. Listen.
Will you find, in all this wide land,
a ruling municipality that is incorrupt?
Is there not a fly in the ointment whichever
way you look? Is not dishonesty
fought with dishonesty; isn&#39;t it corruption
against corruption? Do you believe
for a minute that you can bring about this
revolution? No, my lad; no. This is a
workaday world; Utopia is dreamland.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
You can easily keep your eye on this man.
If he makes a dishonest move, you can
find it in your power to remove him effectually.
But I swear to you that he is
absolutely necessary.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I will assume the risk of his displeasure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Show him your document, and tell
him that if he leaves you in the lurch at
the polls, you&#39;ll send him to prison.
That&#39;s the only way out.&quot; McDermott
thought he saw light.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Make a blackmailer of myself?
Hardly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sorry.&quot; McDermott rose. &quot;You
are digging a pit for a very bright future.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Politically, perhaps.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you are defeated, there is no possible
method of sending you to Washington
in Miller&#39;s place. You must have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
popularity to back you. I have observed
that you are a very ambitious young man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not so ambitious as to obscure my
sense of right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I like your pluck, my boy, though it
stands in your own light. I&#39;ll do all I can
to pacify Murphy. Good night and good
luck to you.&quot; And McDermott made his
departure.</p>

<p class="indent">Newcomb remained motionless in his
chair, studying the night. So much for
his dreams! He knew what McDermott&#39;s
&quot;I&#39;ll do what I can&quot; meant. If only he
had not put his heart so thoroughly into
the campaign! Was there any honesty?
Was it worth while to be true to oneself?
Murphy controlled nearly four hundred
votes. For six years the eighth ward had
carried the Democratic party into victory.
Had he turned this aside? For
years the elections had been like cheese-parings;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
and in ten years there hadn&#39;t
been a majority of five hundred votes on
either side. If Murphy was a genuine
party man, and not a leech, he would
stand square for his party and not consider
personal enmity. What would he do
when he heard from McDermott that he
(Newcomb) had deliberately crossed him
off the ticket of appointees?</p>

<p class="indent">From among some old papers in a
drawer Newcomb produced the portrait
of a young girl of sixteen in fancy dress.
When he had studied this a certain length
of time, he took out another portrait: it
was the young girl grown into superb
womanhood. The eyes were kind and
merry, the mouth beautiful, the brow fine
and smooth like a young poet&#39;s, a nose
with the slightest tilt; altogether a high-bred,
queenly, womanly face, such as
makes a man desire to do great things in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
the world. Newcomb had always loved
her. He had gone through the various
phases: the boy, the diffident youth, the
man. (Usually it takes three women to
bring about these changes!) There was
nothing wild or incoherent in his love,
nothing violent or passionate; rather the
serene light, the steady burning light,
that guides the ships at sea; constant, enduring,
a sure beacon.</p>

<p class="indent">As he studied the face from all angles,
his jaws hardened. He lifted his chin defiantly.
He had the right to love her; he
had lived cleanly, he had dealt justly to
both his friends and his enemies, he owed
no man, he was bound only to his mother,
who had taught him the principles of
manly living. He had the right to love
any woman in the world.... And
there was Williard&mdash;handsome, easy-going
old Dick! Why was it written that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
their paths must cross in everything? Yes,
Dick loved her, too, but with an affection
that had come only with majority. Williard
had everything to offer besides.
Should he step down and aside for his
friend? Did friendship demand such a
sacrifice? No! Let Williard fight for her
as he (Newcomb) intended to fight for
her; and if Williard won, there would be
time then to surrender.</p>

<p class="indent">It was almost twelve when the scrub-woman
aroused him from his reveries.
He closed his desk and went home, his
heart full of battle. He would put up the
best fight that was in him, for love and
for fame; and if he lost he would still
have his manhood and self-respect, which
any woman might be proud to find at her
feet, to accept or decline. He would go
into Murphy&#39;s own country and fight him
openly and without secret weapons. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
knew very well that he held it in his
power to coerce Murphy, but that wasn&#39;t
fighting.</p>

<p class="indent">Neither of the candidates slept well
that night.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">So the time went forward. The second
Tuesday in November was but a fortnight
off. Newcomb fought every inch of
ground. He depended but little, if any,
upon McDermott&#39;s assistance, though
that gentleman came gallantly to his rescue,
as it was necessary to save his own
scalp. It crept into the papers that there
was a rupture between Murphy and the
Democratic candidate. The opposition
papers cried in glee; the others remained
silent. Murphy said nothing when questioned;
he simply smiled. Newcomb
won the respect of his opponents. The laboring
classes saw in him a Moses, and</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
they hailed him with cheers whenever
they saw him.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 440px;">
<img class="border" src="images/p0143-illus.png" width="440" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="indent">There were many laughable episodes
during the heat of the campaign; but
Newcomb knew how and when to laugh.
He answered questions from the platform,
and the ill-mannered were invariably
put to rout by his good-natured wit.
Once they hoisted him on top of a bar
in an obscure saloon. His shoulders
touched the gloomy ceiling, and he was
forced to address the habitués, with his
head bent like a turtle&#39;s, his nose and eyes
offended by the heat and reek of kerosene
and cheap tobacco. They had brought
him there to bait him; they carried him
out on their shoulders. To those who
wanted facts he gave facts; to some he
told humorous stories, more or less applicable;
and to others he spoke his sincere
convictions.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
Meantime Williard took hold of affairs,
but in a bored fashion. He did the
best he knew how, but it wasn&#39;t the best
that wins high place in the affections of
the people.</p>

<p class="indent">The betting was even.</p>

<p class="indent">Election day came round finally&mdash;one
of those rare days when the pallid ghost
of summer returns to view her past victories,
when the broad wings of the West
go a-winnowing the skies, and the sun
shines warm and grateful. On that morning
a change took place in Newcomb&#39;s
heart. He became filled with dread.
After leaving the voting-polls early in the
morning, he returned to his home and
refused to see any one. He even had the
telephone wires cut. Only his mother saw
him, and hovered about him with a thousand
kindly attentions. At the door she
became a veritable dragon; not even telegraph
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
messengers could pass her or
escape her vigilance.</p>

<p class="indent">At six in the evening Newcomb ordered
around his horse. He mounted and
rode away into the hill country south of
the city, into the cold crisp autumn air.
There was fever in his veins that needed
cooling; there were doubts and fears in
his mind that needed clearing. He wanted
that sense of physical exhaustion which
makes a man indifferent to mental blows.</p>

<p class="indent">The day passed and the night came.
Election night! The noisy, good-natured
crowds in the streets, the jostling, snail-moving
crowds! The illuminated canvas-sheets
in front of the newspaper offices!
The blare of horns, the cries, the yells, the
hoots and hurrahs! The petty street
fights! The stalled surface-cars, the
swearing cabbies, the venders of horns
and whistles, the newsboys hawking their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
extras! It is the greatest of all spectacular
nights; humanity comes out into the open.</p>

<p class="indent">The newspaper offices were yellow
with lights. It was a busy time. There
was a continuous coming and going of
messengers, bringing in returns. The
newspaper men took off their coats and
rolled up their sleeves. Figures, figures,
thousands of figures to sift and resift!
Filtering through the various noises was
the maddening click of the telegraph instruments.
Great drifts of waste paper
littered the floors. A sandwich man
served coffee and sandwiches. The chief
distributed cigars. Everybody was writing,
writing. Five men were sent out to
hunt for Newcomb, but none could find
him. His mother refused to state where
he had gone; in fact, she knew nothing
save that he had gone horseback riding.</p>

<p class="indent">At nine there was a gathering at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
club. Williard was there, and all who
had charge of the wheels within wheels.
They had ensconced themselves in the
huge davenports in the bow-window facing
the street, and had given orders to
the steward to charge everything that
night to Senator Gordon. A fabulous
number of corks were pulled; but gentlemen
are always orderly.</p>

<p class="indent">Williard, however, seemed anything
but happy. He had dined at the senator&#39;s
that evening, and something had taken
place there which the general public
would never learn. He was gloomy, and
the wine he drank only added to his
gloom.</p>

<p class="indent">The younger element began to wander
in, carrying those execrable rooster-posters.
A gay time ensued.</p>

<p class="indent">Newcomb had ridden twelve miles into
the country. At eight o&#39;clock the temperature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
changed and it began to snow.
He turned and rode back toward the
city, toward victory or defeat. Sometimes
he went at a canter, sometimes at a
trot. By and by he could see the aureola
from the electric lights wavering above
the city. Once he struck a wind-match
and glanced at his watch. Had he lost or
had he won? A whimsical inspiration
came to him. He determined to hear victory
or defeat from the lips of the girl he
loved. The snow fell softly into his face
and melted. His hair became matted over
his eyes; his gauntlets dripped and the
reins became slippery; a steam rose from
the horse&#39;s body, a big-hearted hunter on
which he had ridden many a mile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good boy!&quot; said Newcomb; &quot;we&#39;ll
have it first from her lips.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Finally he struck the asphalt of the city
limits, and he slowed down to a walk. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
turned into obscure streets. Whenever he
saw a bonfire, he evaded it.</p>

<p class="indent">It was ten o&#39;clock when he drew up in
front of the Gordon home. He tied his
horse to the post with the hitching-chain
and knotted the reins so that they would
not slip over the horse&#39;s head, wiped his
face with his handkerchief, and walked
bravely up to the veranda. There were
few lights. Through the library window
he saw the girl standing at the telephone.
He prayed that she might be wholly
alone. After a moment&#39;s hesitation he
pressed the button and waited.</p>

<p class="indent">Betty herself came to the door. She
peered out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did not expect that you would recognize
me,&quot; said Newcomb, laughing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;John? Where in the world did you
come from?&quot; taking him by the arm and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
dragging him into the hall. &quot;Good gracious!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The truth is, Betty, I took to my heels
at six o&#39;clock, and have been riding
around the country ever since.&quot; He sent
her a penetrating glance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come in to the fire,&quot; she cried impulsively.
&quot;You are cold and wet and hungry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only wet,&quot; he admitted as he entered
the cheerful library. He went directly to
the blazing grate and spread out his red,
wet, aching hands. He could hear her
bustling about; it was a pleasant sound.
A chair rolled up to the fender; the rattle
of a tea-table followed. It was all very
fine. &quot;I ought to be ashamed to enter a
house in these reeking clothes,&quot; he said;
&quot;but the temptation was too great.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are always welcome, John,&quot;
softly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
His keen ear caught the melancholy
sympathy in her tone. He shrugged. He
had lost the fight. Had he won, she would
already have poured forth her congratulations.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sit down,&quot; she commanded, &quot;while I
get the tea. Or would you prefer
brandy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The tea, by all means. I do not need
brandy to bolster up my courage.&quot; He
sat down.</p>

<p class="indent">She left the room and returned shortly
with biscuit and tea. She filled a cup, put
in two lumps of sugar, and passed the cup
to him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ve a good memory,&quot; he said,
smiling at her. &quot;It&#39;s nice to have one&#39;s
likes remembered, even in a cup of tea. I
look as if I had been to war, don&#39;t I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She buttered a biscuit. He ate it, not
because he was hungry, but because her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
fingers had touched it. It was a phantom
kiss. He put the cup down.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, which is it; have I been licked,
or have I won?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What!&quot; she cried; &quot;do you mean to
tell me you do not know?&quot; She gazed at
him bewilderedly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have been four hours in the saddle.
I know nothing, save that which instinct
and the sweet melancholy of your voice
tell me. Betty, tell me, I&#39;ve been licked,
haven&#39;t I, and old Dick has gone and done
it, eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl choked for a moment; there
was a sob in her throat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, John.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Newcomb reached over and tapped
the hearth with his riding-crop, absent-mindedly.
The girl gazed at him, her
eyes shining in a mist of unshed tears....
She longed to reach out her hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
and smooth the furrows from his careworn
brow, to brush the melting crystals
of snow from his hair; longed to soothe
the smart of defeat which she knew was
burning his heart. She knew that only
strong men suffer in silence.</p>

<p class="indent">From a half-opened window the night
breathed upon them, freighted with the
far-off murmur of voices.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I confess to you that I built too much
on the outcome. I am ambitious; I want
to be somebody, to take part in the great
affairs of the world. I fought the very
best I knew how. I had many dreams.
Do you recollect the verses I used to write
to you when we were children? There
was always something of the poet in me,
and it is still there, only it no longer develops
on paper. I had looked toward
Washington ... even toward you,
Betty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
Silence. The girl sat very still. Her
face was white and her eyes large.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am honest. I can see now that I have
no business in politics....&quot; He
laughed suddenly and turned toward the
girl. &quot;I was on the verge of wailing. I&#39;m
licked, and I must begin all over again.
Dick will make a good mayor, that is, if
they leave him alone.... Whimsical,
wasn&#39;t it, of me, coming here to
have you tell me the news?&quot; He looked
away.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl smiled and held out her hand
to him, and as he did not see it, laid it
gently on his sleeve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It does not matter, John. Some day
you will realize all your ambitions. You
are not the kind of man who gives up.
Defeat is a necessary step to greatness;
and you will become great. I am glad
that you came to me.&quot; She knew now; all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
her doubts were gone, all the confusing
shadows.</p>

<p class="indent">Newcomb turned and touched her hand
with his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why did you come to me?&quot; she asked
with fine courage.</p>

<p class="indent">His eyes widened. &quot;Why did I come to
you? If I had won I should have told
you. But I haven&#39;t won; I have lost.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does that make the difference so
great?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It makes the difficulty greater.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me!&quot; with a voice of command.</p>

<p class="indent">They both rose suddenly, rather unconsciously,
too. Their glances held, magnet
and needle-wise. Across the street a bonfire
blazed, and the ruddy light threw a
mellow rose over their strained faces.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I love you,&quot; he said simply. &quot;That is
what drew me here, that is what has always
drawn me here. But say nothing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
me, Betty. God knows I am not strong
enough to suffer two defeats in one night.
God bless you and make you happy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He turned and took a few steps toward
the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If it were not defeat ... if it
were victory?&quot; she said, in a kind of whisper,
her hands on the back of the chair.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The senator came in about midnight.
He found his daughter asleep in a chair
before a half-dead fire. There was a tender
smile on her lips. He touched her
gently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is you, daddy?&quot; Her glance traveled
from his florid countenance to the
clock. &quot;Mercy! I have been dreaming
these two hours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you suppose Newcomb did
to-night?&quot; lighting a cigar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did he do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
&quot;Came into the club and congratulated
Williard publicly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He did that?&quot; cried the girl, her
cheeks dyeing exquisitely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did it like a man, too.&quot; The senator
dropped into a chair. &quot;It was a great victory,
my girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Betty smiled. &quot;Yes, it was.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span></p>

<h2>THE ADVENT OF MR. &quot;SHIFTY&quot; SULLIVAN</h2>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;IT is positively dreadful!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Even with the puckered brow
and drooping lips, Mrs. Cathewe
was a most charming young person.</p>

<p class="indent">Absently she breathed upon the chilled
window-pane, and with the pink horn of
her tapering forefinger drew letters and
grotesque noses and millions on millions
of money.</p>

<p class="indent">Who has not, at one time or another,
pursued art and riches in this harmless
fashion?</p>

<p class="indent">The outlook&mdash;from the window, not
the millions&mdash;was not one to promote any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
degree of cheerfulness, being of darkness,
glistening pavements and a steady, blurring
rain; and at this particular moment
Mrs. Cathewe was quite in sympathy with
the outlook; that is to say, dismal.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only last week,&quot; she went on, &quot;it was
an actor out of employ, a man with reversible
cuffs and a celluloid collar; but
even he knew the difference between
bouillon and tea. And now, Heaven have
mercy, it is a prize-fighter!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Cathewe reopened the note which
in her wrath she had crushed in her left
hand, and again read it aloud:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Dear Nancy</span>&mdash;Am bringing home Sullivan,
the boxer, to dinner. Now, ducky, don&#39;t get mad.
I want to study him at close range. You know
that I am to have a great boxing scene in my new
book, and this study is absolutely necessary. In
haste.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Jack.</span>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Cathewe turned pathetically to
her companion.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
&quot;Isn&#39;t it awful? A prize-fighter, in
spite of all this reform movement! A
pugilist!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A pug, as my brother would tersely
but inelegantly express it,&quot; and Caroline
Boderick lifted an exquisitely molded
chin and laughed; a rollicking laugh
which, in spite of her endeavor to remain
unmoved, twisted up the corners of Mrs.
Cathewe&#39;s rebel mouth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forgive me, Nan, if I laugh; but who
in the world could help it? It is so droll.
This is the greatest house! Imagine, I
had the blues the worst kind of way to-day;
and now I shall be laughing for a
whole week. You dear girl, what do you
care? You&#39;ll be laughing, too, presently.
When a woman marries a successful
painter or a popular novelist, she will
find that she has wedded also a life full
of surprises, full of amusing scenes; ennui
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
is a word cast forth to wander among
commonplace folk. Your husband must
have his model, just the same as if he were
an artist, which he undeniably is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Models!&quot; scornfully. &quot;I wish he were
a romanticist. I declare, if this realism
keeps on, I shall go and live in the country!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And have your husband&#39;s curios remain
all night instead of simply dining.&quot;
And Caroline pressed her hands against
her sides.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is it; laugh, laugh! Carol, you
have no more sympathy than a turtle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are laughing yourself,&quot; said Caroline.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is because I&#39;m looking at you. Why,
I am positively raging!&quot; She tore her
husband&#39;s letter into shreds and cast them
at her feet. &quot;Jack is always upsetting my
choicest plans.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
&quot;And my sobriety. If I had a husband
like <i>yours</i> I should always be the happiest
and merriest woman in the world. What
a happy woman you must and ought to
be!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am, Carol, I am; but there are times
when Jack is as terrible and uncertain as
Mark Twain&#39;s New England weather.
Supposing I had been giving a big dinner
to-night? It would have been just the
same.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only more amusing. Fancy Mrs. Nottingham-Stuart
taking inventory of this
Mr. Sullivan through that pince-nez of
hers!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A thought suddenly sobered Mrs.
Cathewe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But whatever shall I do, Carol? I
have invited the rector to dine with us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mirth spread its sunny wings and flew
away, leaving Caroline&#39;s beautiful eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
thoughtful and contemplative. &quot;I understood
that it was to be a very little dinner
for the family.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Carol, why don&#39;t you like the rector?
He is almost handsome.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do like him, Nan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t mean in that way,&quot; impulsively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In what way?&quot; asked Caroline, her
voice losing some of its warmth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Passively.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The faint, perpendicular line above
Caroline&#39;s nose was the only sign of her
displeasure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has he proposed to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gracious sakes! one would think that
the rector was in love with me. Nan, you
are very embarrassing when you look like
that. Match-making isn&#39;t your forte. Besides,
the rector and I do not get on very
well. Bifurcated riding skirts are not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
his fancy; and I would not give up my
morning ride for the best man living. Oh,
Nan, you ought to ride a horse; there&#39;s
nothing like it in the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The rector has called upon you more
than any other girl in town.&quot; When Mrs.
Cathewe had an idea, she was very persistent
about it. &quot;I have even seen him
watching you when delivering a sermon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Caroline laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Calling doesn&#39;t signify. And you must
remember, daddy is the banker of St.
Paul&#39;s. No, Nan; I don&#39;t mean that; I
am sure that the rector&#39;s calls have nothing
to do with the finances of the church.
But, to tell the truth, daddy calls him a
mollycoddle; says he hasn&#39;t enough gumption&mdash;whatever
that may be&mdash;to stand up
for himself at the trustees&#39; meetings. All
the trustees are opposed to him because he
is not over thirty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
&quot;And the best-looking rector the
church ever had,&quot; supplemented Mrs.
Cathewe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But a mollycoddle, Nan! You
wouldn&#39;t have me marry a mollycoddle,
would you?&quot; There was a covert plea in
her tones which urged Mrs. Cathewe emphatically
to deny that the Reverend
Richard Allen was a mollycoddle.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Cathewe did deny it. &quot;He is not
a mollycoddle, and you very well know it.
Jack says that his meekness and humility
is all a sham.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A hypocrite!&quot; sitting up very straight.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mercy, no! His meekness is merely a
sign of splendid self-control. No man
could be a mollycoddle and have eyes like
his. True, they are mild, but of the mildness
of the sea on a calm day. &#39;Ware of
the hurricane!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has Mr. Cathewe found out yet to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
what college he belonged before he became
a divinity student?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; and even I have never had the
courage to ask him. But Jack thinks it
is Harvard, because the rector let slip one
day something about Cambridge. Why
don&#39;t you write to ask your brother about
him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For reasons best known to herself,
Caroline did not answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you ever going to get married?
You are twenty-four.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Caroline was laughing again; but it
was not the same spirit of mirth that had
been called into life by the possible and
probable advent of Mr. &quot;Shifty&quot; Sullivan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You ought to get married,&quot; declared
Mrs. Cathewe. &quot;Think of the dinners
and teas I should give, following the announcement.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
&quot;It is almost worth the risk,&quot; mockingly.
Caroline arose and walked over to
the grate and sat down in the Morris
chair. She took up the tongs and stirred
the maple log. The spurt of flame discovered
a face almost as beautiful as it
was interesting and amiable. Her principal
claim to beauty, however, lay in her
eyes, which were large and brown, with
a glister of gold in the rim of that part of
the iris which immediately surrounded
the pupil. With these eyes she was fascinating;
even her dearest friends admitted
this; and she was without caprices, which
is a rare trait in a beautiful woman. She
was also as independent as the Declaration
which her mother&#39;s grandfather
signed a hundred and some odd years before.
She came naturally into the spirit,
her father being a retired army officer,
now the financial mainstay of St. Paul&#39;s,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
of which the Reverend Richard Allen
had recently been duly appointed rector.</p>

<p class="indent">It is propitious to observe at once that
the general possessed an unreliable liver
and a battered shin which always ached
with rheumatism during rainy weather.
Only two persons dared to cross him on
stormy days&mdash;his daughter and his son.
The son was completing his final year at
Harvard in the double capacity of so-and-so
on the &#39;varsity crew and some-place-or-other
on the eleven, and felt the importance
of the luster which he was adding to
the historic family name. But this story
in nowise concerns him; rather the adventures
of Mr. Sullivan, the pugilist,
and the rector of St. Paul.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mollycoddle,&quot; mused Caroline, replacing
the tongs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, your father&#39;s judgment is not infallible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
&quot;It is where courage is concerned,&quot; retorted
Caroline.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, what&#39;s a mollycoddle, anyway?&quot;
demanded Mrs. Cathewe, forgetting for
the time being her own imminent troubles.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does Webster define it? I do not recall.
But at any rate the accepted meaning
of the word is a person without a
backbone, a human being with rubber
vertebræ, as daddy expresses it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, fudge! your father likes men who
slam doors, talk loudly, and bang their
fists in their palms.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not always,&quot; smiling; &quot;at least on
days like this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I understand,&quot; replied Mrs.
Cathewe, laughing. &quot;B-r-r-r! I can see
him. Jack says he eats them alive, whatever
he means by that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor daddy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I remember the late rector. Whenever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
he made a begging call he first asked
the servant at the door, &#39;How&#39;s the general&#39;s
liver to-day?&#39; &#39;Bad, bad, your worship.&#39;
I overheard this dialogue one day
while waiting for you. I had to bury my
head in the sofa pillows.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are going to have Brussels
sprouts for salad?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Why?&quot; amused at this queer
turn in the conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was wondering if your Mr. Sullivan
will call them amateur cabbages?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why did you remind me of him? I
had almost forgotten him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If only I can keep a sober face!&quot; said
Caroline, clasping her hands. &quot;If he
wears a dress suit, it is sure to pucker
across the shoulders, be short in the
sleeves, and generally wrinkled. He will
wear a huge yellow stone, and his hair
will be clipped close to the skull. It will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
be covered with as many white scars as a
map with railroad tracks. &#39;Mr. Sullivan,
permit me to introduce the Reverend
Richard Allen.&#39; &#39;Sure.&#39; Oh, it is rich!&quot;
And the laughter which followed smothered
the sound of closing doors. &quot;Nan, it
is a tonic. I wish I were a novelist&#39;s wife.
&#39;Mr. Sullivan, I am charmed to meet
you.&#39; I can imagine the rector&#39;s horror.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what is going to horrify the rector?&quot;
asked a manly voice from the doorway.</p>

<p class="indent">Both women turned guiltily, each uttering
a little cry of surprise and dismay.
They beheld a young man of thirty, of
medium height, who looked shorter than
he really was because of the breadth of
his shoulders. His face was clean-shaven
and manly; the head was well developed,
the chin decided, the blue-gray eyes
alight with animation and expectancy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
The clerical frock was buttoned closely
to the throat, giving emphasis to the
splendid breathing powers concealed beneath.
The Reverend Richard Allen
looked all things save the mollycoddle, as
the flush on Caroline&#39;s cheeks conceded.
And as she arose, she vaguely wondered
how much he had heard.</p>

<p class="indent">The rector, being above all things a
gentleman, did not press his question. He
came forward and shook hands, and then
spread his fingers over the crackling log.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you suppose has happened
to me this day?&quot; he began, turning his
back to the blaze and looking first at Mrs.
Cathewe because she was his hostess, and
then at Caroline because she was the
woman who lived first in his thoughts.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have found a worthy mendicant?&quot;
suggested Caroline, taking up the
hand-screen and shading her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
&quot;Cold, cold.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have been asked to make an address
before some woman&#39;s club,&quot; Mrs.
Cathewe offered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Still cold. No. The <i>Morning Post</i>
has asked me, in the interests of reform, to
write up the prize-fight to-morrow night
between Sullivan and McManus, setting
forth the contest in all its brutality.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The two women looked at each
other and laughed nervously. The same
thought had occurred to each.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Allen,&quot; said Mrs. Cathewe, deciding
immediately to explain the cause
of her merriment, &quot;as you entered you
must have overheard us speak of a Mr.
Sullivan. You know how eccentric Mr.
Cathewe is. Well, when I invited you to
dine this evening I had no idea that this
husband of mine was going to bring home
Mr. Sullivan in order to study him at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
close range, as a possible character in a
new book he is writing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The rector stroked his chin. Caroline,
observing him shyly, was positive that the
luster in his eyes was due to suppressed
laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That will be quite a diversion,&quot; he
said, seating himself. What a charming
profile this girl possessed! Heigh-ho! between
riches and poverty the chasm grew
wide.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And we have been amusing ourselves
by dissecting Mr. Sullivan,&quot; added the
woman with the charming profile. &quot;I
suggested that if he wore a dress suit it
would be either too large or too small.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mercy!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Cathewe,
rising suddenly as the hall door slammed,
&quot;I believe he has come already. Whatever
shall I do, Carol, whatever shall I
do?&quot; in a loud whisper.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
The rector got up and smiled at Caroline,
who returned the smile. In the matter
of appreciating humor, she and the
rector stood upon common ground.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently the novelist and his guest entered.
Both he and Mr. Sullivan appeared
to be in the best of spirits, for their
mouths were twisted in grins.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear,&quot; began Cathewe, &quot;this is
Mr. Sullivan; Mr. Sullivan, Miss Boderick
and the Reverend Richard Allen, of
St. Paul&#39;s.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am delighted,&quot; said Mr. Sullivan,
bowing.</p>

<p class="indent">There was not a wrinkle in Mr. Sullivan&#39;s
dress suit; there were no diamond
studs in his shirt bosom, no watch-chain;
just the rims of his cuffs appeared, and
these were of immaculate linen. His hair
was black and thick and soft as hair always
is that is frequently subjected to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
soap and water. In fact, there was only
one sign which betrayed Mr. Sullivan&#39;s
profitable but equivocal business in life,
and this was an ear which somewhat resembled
a withered mushroom.</p>

<p class="indent">Caroline was disconcerted; she was
even embarrassed. This pleasant-faced
gentleman bowing to her was as far removed
from her preconceived idea of a
pugilist as the earth is removed from the
sun. She did not know&mdash;as the wise
writer knows&mdash;that it is only pugilists
who can not fight who are all scarred and
battered. She saw the rector shake Mr.
Sullivan&#39;s hand. From him her gaze
roved to Mrs. Cathewe, and the look of
perplexity on that young matron&#39;s face
caused her to smother the sudden wild desire
to laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear, I shall leave you to entertain
Mr. Sullivan while I change my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
clothes;&quot; and Cathewe rushed from the
room. He was a man who could not hold
in laughter very successfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come over to the fire and warm yourself,&quot;
said the rector pleasantly. The look
of entreaty in Mrs. Cathewe&#39;s eyes could
not possibly be ignored.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Sullivan crossed the room, gazing
about curiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I haven&#39;t th&#39; slightest idea, ma&#39;am,&quot;
said the famed pugilist, addressing his
hostess, &quot;what your husband&#39;s graft is;
but I understand he&#39;s a literary fellow
that writes books, an&#39; I suppose he knows
why he ast me here t&#39; eat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Caroline sighed with relief; his voice
was very nearly what she expected it
would be.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An&#39; besides,&quot; continued Mr. Sullivan,
&quot;I&#39;m kind o&#39; curious myself t&#39; see you
swells get outside your feed. I ain&#39;t stuck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
on these togs, generally; a man&#39;s afraid
t&#39; breathe hearty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Cathewe shuddered slightly; Mr.
Sullivan was rubbing the cold from his
fungus-like ear. What should she do to
entertain this man? she wondered. She
glanced despairingly at Caroline; but
Caroline was looking at the rector, who
in turn seemed absorbed in Mr. Sullivan.
She was without help; telegraphic communication
was cut off, as it were.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think it will snow to-night?&quot;
she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It looks like it would,&quot; answered Mr.
Sullivan, with a polite but furtive glance
at the window. &quot;Though there&#39;ll be a
bigger push out to-morrer if it&#39;s clear.
It&#39;s goin&#39; t&#39; be a good fight. D&#39; you ever
see a scrap, sir?&quot; he asked, turning to the
rector.</p>

<p class="indent">Caroline wondered if it was the fire or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
the rector&#39;s own blood which darkened
his cheek.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I belong to the clergy,&quot; said the rector
softly; &quot;it is our duty not to witness fights,
but to prevent them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, I say!&quot; remonstrated Mr. Sullivan,
&quot;you folks run around in your
autos, knock down people an&#39; frighten
horses, so&#39;s they run away; you go out an&#39;
kill thousands of birds an&#39; deer an&#39; fish,
an&#39; all that; an&#39; yet you&#39;re th&#39; first t&#39; holler
when two healthy men pummel each
other for a livin&#39;. You ain&#39;t consistent.
Why, th&#39; hardest punch I ever got never
pained me more&#39;n an hour, an&#39; I took th&#39;
fat end of th&#39; purse at that. When you&#39;re
a kid, ain&#39;t you always quarrelin&#39; an&#39;
scrappin&#39;? Sure. Sometimes it was with
reason an&#39; cause, an&#39; again jus&#39; plain love
of fightin&#39;. Well, that&#39;s me. I fight because
I like it, an&#39; because it pays. Sure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
It&#39;s on&#39;y natural for some of us t&#39; fight all
th&#39; time; an&#39; honest, I&#39;m dead weary of th&#39;
way th&#39; papers yell about th&#39; brutal prize-fight.
If I want t&#39; get my block punched
off, that&#39;s my affair; an&#39; I don&#39;t see what
business some old fussies have in interferin&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It isn&#39;t really the fighting, Mr. Sullivan,&quot;
replied the rector, who felt compelled
to defend his point of view; &quot;it&#39;s
the rough element which is always
brought to the surface during these engagements.
Men drink and use profane
language and wager money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As t&#39; that, I don&#39;t say;&quot; and Mr. Sullivan
moved his hands in a manner which
explained his inability to account for the
transgressions of the common race.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s a block?&quot; whispered Mrs.
Cathewe into Caroline&#39;s ear.</p>

<p class="indent">Caroline raised her eyebrows; she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
almost surrendered to the first natural impulse,
that of raising her hands above her
head, as she had often seen her brother do
when faced by an unanswerable question.</p>

<p class="indent">The trend of conversation veered. Mr.
Sullivan declared that he would never go
upon the stage, and all laughed. Occasionally
the women ventured timidly to
offer an observation which invariably
caused Mr. Sullivan to loose an expansive
grin. And when he learned that the rector
was to witness the fight in the capacity
of a reporter, he enjoyed the knowledge
hugely.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently Cathewe appeared, and dinner
was announced. Mr. Sullivan sat between
his host and hostess. No, he would
not have a cocktail nor a highball; he
never drank. Mrs. Cathewe straightway
marked him down as a rank impostor.
Didn&#39;t prize-fighters always drink and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
carouse and get locked up by the police
officers?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, this is a new one on me,&quot; Mr.
Sullivan admitted, as he tasted of his
caviar and quietly dropped his fork.
&quot;May I ask what it is?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s Russian caviar. It is like Russian
literature; one has to cultivate a taste for
it.&quot; The novelist glanced amusedly at the
rector.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It reminds me of what happened t&#39;
me at White Plains a couple of years ago.
I was in trainin&#39; that fall at Mulligan&#39;s.
You&#39;ve heard of Mulligan; greatest man
on th&#39; mat in his time. Well, I bucked up
against French spinach. Says he: &#39;Eat
it.&#39; Says I, &#39;I don&#39;t like it.&#39; Says he, &#39;I
don&#39;t care whether you like it or not. I
don&#39;t like your mug, but I have t&#39; put up
with it. Eat that spinach.&#39; Says I, &#39;I don&#39;t
see how I can eat it if I don&#39;t like it.&#39;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
An&#39; an hour after he gives me th&#39; bill, an&#39;
I&#39;d have had on&#39;y thirty minutes t&#39; get
out but for th&#39; housekeeper, who patched
it up. Those were great times. Sure.
Well, no spinach or caviar in mine. Now
say, what&#39;s th&#39; game? Do you want my
history, or jus&#39; a scrap or two?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Describe how you won the championship
from McGonegal,&quot; said Cathewe
eagerly, nodding to the butler to serve the
oysters.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Sullivan toyed with the filigree
butter-knife, mentally deciding that its
use was for cutting pie. He cast an
oblique glance at the immobile countenance
of the English butler, and
ahemmed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; he began, &quot;it was like
this....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As Mr. Sullivan went on, a series of
whispered questions and answers was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
started between Caroline and the rector.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Caroline</i>: What does he mean by
&quot;block&quot;?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>The Rector</i>: His head, I believe.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Caroline</i>: Oh!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mr. Sullivan</i>: There wasn&#39;t much
doin&#39; in th&#39; third round. We fiddled a
while. On&#39;y once did either of us get t&#39;
th&#39; ropes ... an&#39; th&#39; bell rang. Th&#39;
fourth was a hot one; hammer an&#39; tongs
from th&#39; start off. He hooked me twice
on th&#39; wind, and I handed him out a jolt
on th&#39; jaw that put him t&#39; th&#39; mat....
I had th&#39; best of th&#39; round.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Caroline</i>: In mercy&#39;s sake, what does
he mean by &quot;slats&quot;?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>The Rector</i> (seized with a slight
coughing): Possibly his ribs.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Caroline</i>: Good gracious! (Whether
this ejaculation was caused by surprise or
by the oyster on which she had put more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
horse-radish than was suited to her palate,
will always remain a mystery.)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mr. Sullivan</i>: We were out for gore
th&#39; fift&#39; round. He was gettin&#39; strong on
his hooks.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. Cathewe</i> (interrupting him with
great timidity): What do you mean by
&quot;hooks&quot;?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mr. Sullivan</i>: It&#39;s a blow like this.
(Illustrates and knocks over the centerpiece.
Water and flowers spread over the
table.) I say, now, look at that. Ain&#39;t I
a Mike now, t&#39; knock over th&#39; flower-pot
like that?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Cathewe</i>: Never mind that, Mr. Sullivan.
Go on with the fight.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mr. Sullivan</i>: Where was I? Oh, yes;
he put it all over me that round....
They had counted eight when th&#39; bell
rang an&#39; saved me.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Caroline</i>: Hit him on the <i>phonograph</i>!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
<i>The Rector</i> (reddening): It is possible
that he refers to Mr. McGonegal&#39;s mouth.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Caroline</i>: Well, I never! And I&#39;ve got
a slangy brother, too, at Harvard.</p>

<p class="indent">(The rector looks gravely at his empty
oyster-shells.)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mr. Sullivan</i>: Things went along
about even till th&#39; tenth, when I blacked
his lamps.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Caroline</i>: Lamps?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>The Rector</i>: Eyes, doubtless.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Caroline</i>: It&#39;s getting too deep for me.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mr. Sullivan</i>: The last round I saw
that I had him goin&#39; all right. In two
seconds I had burgundy flowin&#39; from his
trombone.</p>

<p class="indent">(Cathewe leans back in his chair and
laughs.)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. Cathewe</i> (bewilderingly): Burgundy?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mr. Sullivan</i> (rather impatiently): A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
jolt on th&#39; nose. Well, there was some
more waltzin&#39;, and then a hook an&#39; a
swing, an&#39; him on th&#39; mat, down an&#39; out.
I made six thousand, an&#39; on&#39;y got this tin
ear t&#39; show for my trouble.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">It was fully ten o&#39;clock when the coffee
was served. Mr. Sullivan may have lost
not a few &quot;e&#39;s&quot; and &quot;g&#39;s&quot; in the passing,
but for all that he proved no small entertainment;
and when he arose with the remark
that he was &quot;for th&#39; tall pines,&quot; both
ladies experienced an amused regret.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Which way do you go?&quot; asked Mr.
Sullivan, laying his hand on the rector&#39;s
arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I pass your hotel. I shall be pleased
to walk with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say,&quot; suddenly exclaimed Mr. Sullivan,
pressing his pudgy fingers into the
rector&#39;s arm, &quot;where did you get this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
arm? Why, it is as tough as a railroad
tie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A course of physical culture,&quot; said
the rector, visibly embarrassed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Physical culture? All right. But
don&#39;t ever get mad at me,&quot; laughed Mr.
Sullivan. &quot;It&#39;s as big as a pile-driver.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The novelist told Mr. Sullivan that he
was very much obliged for his company.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t mention it. Drop int&#39; th&#39; fight
to-morrer night. You&#39;ll get more ideas
there&#39;n you will hearin&#39; me shoot hot air.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Cathewe looked slyly at his wife. He
was a man, and more than once he had
slipped away from the club and taken in
the last few rounds, and then had returned
home to say what a dull night he
had had at the club.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Cathewe had her arm lovingly
around Caroline&#39;s waist. All at once she
felt Caroline start.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
&quot;What is it?&quot; she whispered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing, nothing!&quot; Caroline declared
quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">But on the way home in her carriage
Caroline wondered where the Reverend
Richard Allen, rector of St. Paul&#39;s, had
acquired <i>his</i> tin ear.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span></p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;DEAR SIS&mdash;Yours received. Have
hunted up the name, and have found
that your Reverend Richard Allen
is an &#39;89 man, one of the best all-round
men we ever had on the track. He was
a terror, too, so an old grad tells me. Got kicked
out in his senior year. It seems that his chum
and roommate was very deeply in the hole, not
extravagantly, like yours truly, but by a series of
hard knocks. Allen had no cash himself. And
you know when you haven&#39;t any money in sight,
you can&#39;t borrow any. One night at the Museum
(there was a cheap show on) a prize-fighter offered
$300 to any one who would stand up before
him for five rounds. Allen jumped up on the
stage and licked the pug to a standstill. He got
a bad swipe on the ear, however; and if your
Allen has what they call a tin ear, an ear that
looks as if my best bullpup had tried to make his
dinner off it, <i>ecce homo</i>! He paid his mate&#39;s
debts, and then was requested to call on the fac.
The old ladies told him to pack up. He did. He
has never returned to college since. But why do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
you want to know all about him? They say he
was a handsome duffer. You know I haven&#39;t
seen him yet, not having been home since last
Easter time. Now, for Heaven&#39;s sake, Sis, don&#39;t
go and get daffy on his Riverince. I&#39;ve got a
man in tow for you, the best fellow that ever
lived.</p>

<p class="author">Affectionately, <span class="smcap">Jack</span>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;P.S.&mdash;Can&#39;t you shove a couple of 50&#39;s in your
next letter to me? The governor&#39;s liver wasn&#39;t
in good shape the first of the month.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Caroline dropped the letter into her
lap and stared out of the window. It
was snowing great, soft, melting flakes.
She did not know whether to laugh or to
cry, nor what occasioned this impulse to
do either. So he was a Cambridge man,
and had been expelled for prize-fighting;
for certainly it had been prize-fighting,
even though the motive had been a good
and manly one.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A milksop!&quot; There was no doubt, no
hesitancy; her laughter rang out fresh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
and clear. What would her father say
when he learned the truth? Her next
thought was, why should the rector pose
as a lamb, patient and unspeaking, when
all the time he was a lion? She alone had
solved the mystery. It was self-control, it
was power. This discovery filled her
with a quiet exultation. She was a
woman, and to unravel a secret was as joyful
a task for her as to invent a fashionable
hat.</p>

<p class="indent">The bygone rectors had interested her
little; they had been either pedants, fanatics,
or social drones; while this man had
gone about his work quietly and modestly.
He never said: &quot;I visited the poor to-day.&quot;
It was the poor who said: &quot;The
rector was here to-day with money and
clothes.&quot; But his past he let remain nebulous;
not even the trustees themselves had
peered far into it, at least not as far back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
as the Cambridge days. Thus, the element
of mystery surrounding him first attracted
her; the man&#39;s personality added
to this. The knowledge that he was a college
man seemed to place him nearer her
social level, though she was not a person
to particularize so long as a man proved
himself; and the rector had, beyond a
doubt, proved himself.</p>

<p class="indent">There were dozens of brilliant young
men following eagerly in her train. They
rode with her, drove with her, and fought
for the privilege of playing caddy to her
game. Yet, while she liked them all, she
cared particularly for none. The rector,
being a new species of man, became a
study. Time and time again she had invited
him to the Country Club; he always
excused himself on the ground that
he was taking a course of reading such as
to demand all his spare time in the day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
One morning she had been riding alone,
and had seen him tramping across country.
In the spirit of fun she took a couple
of fences and caught up with him. He
had appeared greatly surprised, even embarrassed,
for her woman&#39;s eye had been
quick to read. She had rallied him upon
his stride. He had become silent. And
this man had &quot;jumped upon the stage and
licked the pug to a standstill!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Carol, are you there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Caroline started and hid the letter.
She arose and admitted her father.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;James says that you received a letter
this afternoon. Was it from the boy?
Begging for money? Well, don&#39;t you
dare to send it to him. The ragamuffin
has overdrawn seven hundred dollars
this month. What&#39;s he think I am, a
United States Steel Corporation?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He has asked me for one hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
dollars, and I am going to send it to the
poor boy to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you are, are you? Who&#39;s bringing
up the scalawag, you or I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are trying to, daddy, but I believe
he&#39;s bent on bringing himself up.&quot; She
ran her fingers through his hair. &quot;I know
the weather&#39;s bad, daddy, but don&#39;t be
cross. Come over to the piano and I&#39;ll
play for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t want any music,&quot; gruffly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come,&quot; dragging him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s the way; I have no authority
in this house. But, seriously, Carol, the
boy&#39;s spending it pretty fast, and it will
not do him a bit of good. I want to make
a man out of him, not a spendthrift. Play
that what-d&#39;you-call-it from Chopin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The <i>Berceuse</i>?&quot; seating herself at the
piano.</p>

<p class="indent">The twilight of winter was fast settling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
down. The house across the way began
to glow at various windows. Still she
played. From Chopin she turned to
Schumann, from Schumann to Rubinstein,
back to Chopin&#39;s polonaise and the
nocturne in E flat major.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You play those with a livelier spirit
than usual,&quot; was the general&#39;s only comment.
How these haunting melodies took
him back to the past, when the girl&#39;s
mother played them in the golden courting
days! He could not see the blush his
comment had brought to his daughter&#39;s
cheek. &quot;My dear, my dear!&quot; he said, with
great tenderness, sliding his arm around
her waist, &quot;I know that I&#39;m cross at times,
but I&#39;m only an old barking dog; don&#39;t do
any harm. I&#39;ll tell you what, if my leg&#39;s
all right next Saturday I&#39;ll ride out to the
Country Club with you, and we&#39;ll have
tea together.&quot;</p>

She leaned toward him and kissed him.
&quot;Daddy, what makes you think so meanly
of the rector? I was thinking of him
when you came in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think meanly of him; but,
hang it, Carol, he always says &#39;Yes&#39; when
I want him to say &#39;No,&#39; and <i>vise versa</i>.
He&#39;s too complacent. I like a man who&#39;s
a human being to kick once in a while, a
man who&#39;s got some fight in him....
What are you laughing at, you torment?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At something which just occurred to
me. There goes the gong for dinner. I
am ravenous.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By the way, I forgot to tell you what
I saw in the evening edition of the <i>Post</i>.
Your parson is going to report the prize-fight
to-night. He&#39;ll be frightened out of
his shoes. I&#39;m going up to the club; going
to play a few rubbers. It&#39;ll make me
forget my grumbling leg. You run over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
to Cathewe&#39;s or telephone Mrs. Cathewe
to run over here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can&#39;t you stay in to-night? I don&#39;t
want anybody but you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I&#39;ve half promised; besides, I&#39;m
sort of blue. I need the excitement.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well; I&#39;ll telephone Nan. Mr.
Cathewe will probably go to that awful
fight in the interests of his new book.
She&#39;ll come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cathewe&#39;s going to the fight, you say?
Humph!&quot; The general scratched his ear
thoughtfully.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span></p>

<p class="center">III</p>

<p>THE auditorium was a great barn-like
building which had been
erected originally for the purpose
of a roller-skating rink. Nowadays the
charity bazaars were held there, the balls,
political mass-meetings, amateur dramatics,
and prize-fights.</p>

<p class="indent">Cathewe, as he gazed curiously around,
pictured to himself the contrast between
the Thanksgiving ball of the past week
and the present scene, and fell into his
usual habit of philosophizing. His seat
was high up in the gallery. What faces
he saw through the blue and choking haze
of smoke! Saloon keepers, idlers, stunted
youth, blasé men about town, with a
sprinkling of respectable business men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
who ever and anon cast hasty and guilty
glances over their shoulders, and when
caught would raise a finger as if to say:
&quot;You rogue, what are <i>you</i> doing here?&quot;&mdash;these
and other sights met his interested
eye. Even he confessed to himself that
his presence here was not all due to the
gathering of color for his new book. Self-analysis
discovered to him that the animal
in him was eagerly awaiting the arrival
of the fighters. Such is human nature.</p>

<p class="indent">Down below he saw the raised platform,
strongly protected by ropes.
Around this were the reporters&#39; tables, the
telegraph operators&#39; desks, a few chairs
for the privileged friends of the press, and
pails, towels and sponges. Yes, there was
the rector, sitting at one of the reporters&#39;
tables, erect in his chair, his gaze bent
upon his paper pad, apparently oblivious
to his strange surroundings. Cathewe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
wondered what was going on in that somewhat
mystifying mind. He certainly
would have been surprised could he have
read.</p>

<p class="indent">In fact, the rector was going over again
his own memorable battle in Boston some
ten years ago. He was thinking how it
had changed his whole career, how it had
swerved him from the bar to the pulpit.</p>

<p class="indent">Ah, to be within the magic circle of
her presence, to be within sight and touch
all his life, sometimes to hear her voice
lifted in song, the smooth, white fingers
bringing to life the poetry of sound! He
had ceased to lie to himself. He loved,
with all his heart, with all his soul. He
had given up; he had surrendered completely;
but she was never to know. Even
at this moment poverty took him to the
mount and showed him the abyss between
him and his heart&#39;s desire. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
aroused from his dreams by a sudden
commotion, a subdued murmur. Mr.
Sullivan&#39;s antagonist, dressed in a gaudy
sky-blue bath-robe, was crawling under
the ropes, followed by his seconds. The
murmur grew into a prolonged cheer
when Mr. Sullivan shortly followed in a
bath-robe, even richer in hues.</p>

<p class="indent">The reporters shifted their writing-pads,
lighted fresh cigars, and drew their
legs under the tables. The sporting editor
of the <i>Post</i> turned to the rector.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll tip you off on the technicalities of
the scrap,&quot; he said. &quot;All you need to do
is to watch the men and describe what
they do in your own way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you,&quot; replied the rector. He
was calm. When Mr. Sullivan nodded
pleasantly, he smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">The men in the ring threw aside their
bath-robes, and stood forth in all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
splendor of their robust physiques. A
short, pompous man, wearing a watch-chain
which threatened to disconcert his
physical balance, stepped to the ropes and
held up his hand. Silence suddenly fell
upon two thousand men.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Th&#39; preliminary is off; th&#39; &#39;Kid&#39; refuses
to go on because th&#39; &#39;Dago&#39; didn&#39;t
weigh in as agreed. Th&#39; main bout will
now take place. Mr. Sullivan t&#39; th&#39; right,
an&#39; Mr. McManus t&#39; th&#39; left.&quot; The pompous
man took out a greasy telegram from
his pocket, and said: &quot;Lanky Williams
challenges th&#39; winner fer a purse an&#39; a side
bet of fi&#39; thousan&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was cheered heartily. Nobody
cared about the preliminary &quot;go&quot;; it was
Sullivan and McManus the spectators
had paid their money to see.</p>

<p class="indent">The rector recalled the scenes in <i>Quo
Vadis</i>, and shrugged his shoulders. Human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
nature never changes; only politics
and fashions. He himself was vaguely
conscious of a guilty thrill as he saw the
two men step from their corners and
shake hands.</p>

<p class="indent">As this is a story not of how Mr.
&quot;Shifty&quot; Sullivan won his battle from
Mr. McManus, but of how the rector of
St. Paul&#39;s nearly lost his, I shall not dwell
upon the battle as it was fought by rounds.
Let it suffice that the crisis came during
the twelfth round. Sullivan was having
the best of this round, though in the four
previous he had been worsted. The men
came together suddenly, and there was
some rough in-fighting. The pompous
man, who was the referee, was kept on the
jump. One could hear the pad-pad of
blows and the scrape-scrape of shoes on
the resined mat, so breathless were the
spectators. The boxers became tangled.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
&quot;Foul, foul!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The voice rang out strong and distinct.
It was not the referee&#39;s voice, for the
referee himself looked angrily down
whence the voice came. Sullivan, his face
writhed in agony, was clinging desperately
to his opponent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A foul blow!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pandemonium. Everybody was yelling,
half not knowing why.</p>

<p class="indent">The seconds and trainers were clambering
into the ring. The referee separated
the boxers. They rushed at each other
furiously. The seconds stepped in between.
A general mix-up followed, during
which the pompous man lost his silk
hat.</p>

<p class="indent">The reporter for the <i>Post</i> pulled the
rector&#39;s coat tails, and the rector sank into
his chair, pale and terrified. He had forgotten!
Carried away by his old love of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
clean fighting, by his love of physical contests,
he had forgotten, forgotten!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Foul! It was a foul!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ye-a! Ye-a! Foul blow!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bully fer th&#39; parson!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sullivan, Sullivan!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;McManus!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Foul, foul! T&#39;row out th&#39; referee!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Give th&#39; deacon a show fer his
money!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">These and a thousand other cries rose
in the vicinity of the rector. Those reporters
whose city editors had not thought
of the stroke of sending a minister of the
gospel to report the fight were delighted.
Here was a story worth forty fights, a
story to delight thousands and thousands
who looked upon St. Paul&#39;s as a place
where only the rich might worship.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I declare the fight a draw, an&#39; all
bets off!&quot; howled the referee, wiping the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
dust from his damaged hat, which he had
at length recovered.</p>

<p class="indent">The rector rose to move down the aisle
to the entrance. He felt morally and
physically crushed. All this would be in
the newspapers the next morning. He
was disgraced; for everybody would ask,
&quot;How should he know what a foul blow
was?&quot; It was terribly bitter, after having
struggled so long. Presently he became
aware that men, reeking with cigar smoke
and liquors, were talking loudly to him,
even cursing him. He caught some words
about &quot;makin&#39; us lose our bets, when we
come all th&#39; way from N&#39;York.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A hand came into contact with his
cheek, and the sting of it ran like fire
through his veins. The wrath at his moral
defeat broke down the dikes of his self-control;
the fury which is always quickly
provoked by physical pain in the animality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
of man, swept aside his prudence. The
man who struck him was seen to rise
bodily and fall crumpled among the seats.
The man&#39;s friends&mdash;there were four in
number&mdash;recovering from their momentary
surprise, attacked the rector swiftly,
and not without a certain conformity.</p>

<p class="indent">What followed has become history.
Even Sullivan and his opponent forgot
their animosity for the time being, and
leaned eagerly over the ropes. Far back
in the surging crowd several police
helmets could be discerned, but they made
little progress. The rector in his tightly
fitting frock was at a disadvantage, but
his wonderful vigor and activity stood
him in good stead. Quick as a cat he
leaped from this side to that, dealing his
blows with the rapidity of a piston-rod
and almost as terrible in effect. Once he
went down; but, like Antæus, the touch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
of earth revived him and doubled his
strength.</p>

<p class="indent">Men, in the mad effort to witness this
battle, trod on one another&#39;s toes, hats
were crushed, coats were torn, even blows
were struck. They stood on chairs, on
tables, yelling and cheering. This was a
fight that <i>was</i> a fight. Faking had no part
in it; there was no partiality of referees.
When the police finally arrived it
was all over. The rector was brushing his
hat, while Cathewe, who had dashed
down-stairs at the first sound of the rector&#39;s
voice, was busy with the rector&#39;s coat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Want t&#39; appear against &#39;em?&quot; asked
one of the officers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no! Let them go,&quot; cried the rector.
&quot;Cathewe, take me out, please; take
me home.&quot; His hands shook as he put on
his hat. He was very white. The knuckles
of his left hand were raw and bleeding.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
The police finally opened a pathway in
the cheering crowd, and through this
Cathewe and the rector disappeared.
Outside, Cathewe hailed a carriage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cathewe, I have absolutely and positively
ruined my career.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The rector sank back among the cushions,
overwhelmed. His voice was uneven
and choked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nonsense!&quot; cried Cathewe. &quot;What
else could you do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I could have passed by the man who
struck me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, pshaw! A man can not help being
human simply because he wears the
cloth. It was the bulliest fight I ever
saw. It was magnificent! They weren&#39;t
in it at any time. And you walloped four
of &#39;em, and one was an ex-pugilist. It was
great.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
&quot;They&#39;ll call you the fighting parson.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall resign to-morrow. I must begin
life all over again. It will be very
hard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Resign nothing! By the way, I saw
General Boderick in the crowd.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Boderick? Oh, I must hurry. He
must have my resignation before he has a
chance to demand it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you worry about him. I saw
him waving his cane like mad when you
got up from the floor and smashed that
second-ward ruffian. He won&#39;t dare to
say anything. His daughter thinks that he
went up to the club.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall resign. I am determined upon
that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ll all have something to say regarding
that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But the newspapers to-morrow! It
will be frightful.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
&quot;My dear fellow, I am about to visit
each in turn, and you can remain in the
carriage. I&#39;ll take upon myself to fix it
up so that it will receive scarcely any
mention at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My eternal gratitude is yours if you
can accomplish that.&quot; There was a note
of hope in the rector&#39;s voice.</p>

<p class="indent">It was after eleven o&#39;clock when Cathewe
deposited the rector before the parsonage.
Cathewe was a great favorite
with the newspaper men, and he had had
no trouble at all in suppressing the sensational
part of the affair.</p>

<p class="indent">As for the rector, he sank wearily into
his study chair and buried his face in his
hands. He had won one fight, but he had
lost another of far more importance.
Somehow, he had always just reached the
promised land to feel the earth slip from
under his feet. He was a failure. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
only thing he had to be thankful for was
that he stood alone in his disgrace. His
father and mother were dead. Where
should he go from here? He hadn&#39;t the
slightest idea. He certainly would never
don the cloth again, for this disgrace
would follow him wherever he went. He
was unfitted for mercantile life; he loved
outdoors too well. If only he possessed
the talent of Cathewe, who could go anywhere
and live anywhere, without altering
his condition! Well, he would go to
the far West; he would put his geological
learning into action; and by the time the
little money he had saved was gone, he
would have something to do.</p>

<p class="indent">Ah, but these things did not comprise
the real bitterness in his heart. He had
stepped outside the circle, stepped down
below the horizon of her affairs. True,
his wildest dreams had never linked his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
life with hers; but the nearness to her was
as life to him. And now all that was
over.</p>

<p class="indent">He reached for his writing-pad and
wrote his resignation. It was a frank letter,
straightforward and manly. He
sealed it and stole out and deposited it in
the letter-box just in time for the night
collector to take it up. He had burned his
bridges. They would be only too glad to
get rid of him. He was absently straightening
the papers on his table, when a
small blue envelope attracted his attention.
A faintness seized him as he recognized
the delicate handwriting. It was an
invitation, couched in the most friendly
terms, to dine with General and Miss
Boderick the following evening. If only
he had seen this note earlier! He bent his
head on his arms, and there was no sound
save the wind in the chimney.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
&quot;The rector, sir,&quot; announced the general&#39;s
valet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Show him in here, James, and light
up,&quot; said the general.</p>

<p class="indent">When the rector entered, the general
greeted him cheerfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sit down, sit down, and let us talk it
all over,&quot; the general began. &quot;I have not
yet turned over your resignation to the
trustees; and yet, in my opinion, this resignation
is the best thing possible under
the circumstances. You were not exactly
cut out for a minister, though you have
done more good to the poor than a dozen
of your predecessors. I wish to apologize
to you for some thoughts I have harbored
against you. Wait a minute, wait a minute,&quot;
as the rector raised a protesting
hand. &quot;I have called you a milksop because
you always accepted the trustees&#39;
rebuffs with a meek and lowly spirit. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
when I saw you lick half a dozen ruffians
last night (yes, I was there; and while
I&#39;m a churchman, I am a man and a soldier
besides), I knew that I had done
you an injustice. By the way, are you related
to the late Chaplain Allen of the
&mdash;&mdash;st Regiment?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was my father,&quot; wonderingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Humph!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was out of regard for him that I
became a divinity student.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Parsons sons are all alike. I never
saw a parson&#39;s son who wasn&#39;t a limb of
the Old Scratch. You became a divinity
student after you left Harvard?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The rector sent his host a startled
glance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I have heard all about that episode;
and I like you all the better for it.
You should have been a soldier. We used
to call your father the &#39;fighting parson.&#39;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
Now, I&#39;ve a proposition to make to you.
Do you know anything about mining?
anything about metals and geology?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir; I have had a large reading
upon those subjects.&quot; The rector&#39;s heart
was thumping.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A practical knowledge?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As practical as it is possible for a man
in my position to acquire.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very good. It is a sorry thing to see a
young man with misdirected energies.
I&#39;ll undertake to direct yours. In January
I want you to go to Mexico for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mexico?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mexico. I have large mining interests
there which need the presence of a man
who can fight, both mentally and physically.
I will pay you a good salary,
and if you win, some stock shall go with
the victory. Now don&#39;t think that I&#39;m doing
this out of sympathy for you. I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
looking at you from a purely commercial
point of view. Will you accept?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;With all my heart,&quot; with a burst of
enthusiasm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s the way to talk. We&#39;ll arrange
about the salary after dinner. Now, go
down to the music-room. You will find
Miss Boderick there. She will manage to
entertain you till dinner time; and while
you are about it, you may thank her instead
of me. I shouldn&#39;t have thought of
you but for her. Don&#39;t worry over what
the newspapers have said. In six months
this affair will have blown over, and you
will have settled the mining dispute one
way or the other. You will excuse me
now, as I have some important letters to
write. And, mind you, if you breathe
a word that I was at the fight last
night ...&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So the Reverend Richard Allen stole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
quietly down to the music-room. It was
dark; and he entered softly and sat down
in a corner at the farther end of the room,
so as not to disturb the musician. In all
the years of his life, the life which numbered
thirty variegated years, he had
never known such happiness.</p>

<p class="indent">In the study above the general chuckled
as he wrote, and murmured from time to
time the word: &quot;Milksop!&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span></p>

<h2>THE GIRL AND THE POET</h2>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p>WILLIARD sat down to his
evening meal. He was later
than usual. The dining-room
of the boarding-house was deserted, save
for the presence of the maid servant, who
was sweeping the crumbs from the tablecloth.
His entrance was acknowledged
by a sour smile. Williard was a sort of
pariah to the narrow minds of that household,
who could not associate greatness of
soul with failure and poverty.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You won&#39;t get much,&quot; said the maid.
&quot;We are too busy with to-morrow&#39;s
Christmas dinner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To-morrow&#39;s Christmas dinner! Williard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
drew the bread-dish toward him
rather mechanically. To-morrow&#39;s
Christmas dinner! It was Christmas Eve
to-night, and he had forgotten! All that
day he had wondered why every face
looked so eager and bright in the office,
why the jostling crowds in the streets
were so merry and good-humored. To-morrow
was Christmas, and he had forgotten!</p>

<p class="indent">The maid grumblingly fetched what
remained of the supper. The hanging
lamp sputtered for lack of oil to feed
upon; and all the food tasted vaguely of
kerosene. But Williard made no complaint;
he was hungry. To-morrow&#39;s
Christmas dinner!</p>

<p class="indent">He was tired. Great names had danced
before his eyes that day: names resounding
the fickle world&#39;s applause and the
jingle of her inconsiderate largess. Not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
that he envied them, no; rather that they
taught him to despair. In the daytime he
read proof in the attic of a large publishing
house; this was existence, it was bread
and butter. But at night, in his little
hall bedroom, where the clamors of the
city streets sounded murmurous and indistinct,
he still clung to the fragments of
early dreams. His verses and stories,
lofty and proud, lacked something, for
they found no entrance to the garden of
fame, which is at best full of false flowers
and spurious scents.</p>

<p class="indent">For ten years he had striven to attain;
and he had failed. He had come to New
York, as thousands of others had come,
with hope and her thousand stars, to see
them fade away one by one from the firmament
of his dreams. The world has
no patience with failure, no treasures for
the obscure defeat. Ah, to see one&#39;s own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
people, dressed in clear, beautiful type,
move across the white pages, from margin
to margin, thinking, acting, speaking!
To unravel the scheme of life, with its
loves, ambitions and revenges&mdash;was there
any rapture, any pleasure, half so fine?</p>

<p class="indent">The harsh voice of the maid brought
him out of his idle dream: for to be a
poet is to dream and to suffer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s a letter under your door,&quot;
said the girl. &quot;Didn&#39;t know you were
coming home to supper, so I didn&#39;t put
it under your plate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess you&#39;ve struck an heiress; that
letter smells of sachet powder,&quot; she added,
sailing through the swinging door to
the kitchen.</p>

<p class="indent">Williard folded his napkin and rose.
Christmas Eve! Where were the old
days in the little white village, the straw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
rides, the candy pulls, the great logs in
the fireplace? Where had youth gone so
suddenly? He climbed the two flights of
stairs to his room, struck a match, and
knelt before the door. Yes, there was a
letter. He held it to his nose and inhaled
the delicate odor of violets. A thrill
passed through him, a thrill that was a
mixture of joy, sorrow, love, bitterness
and regret.</p>

<p class="indent">He unlocked the door, entered the
room and lighted the gas. How well he
knew the stroke of each letter! How
many times in the old days had that feathery
tracing brought cheer and comfort to
him! And now she was gone; out of his
meager circle she had passed for ever.
Riches! What a fortress! What a parapet
to scale! What a barrier! The
mighty dollar now bastioned and sentineled
her as the drab granite and men-at-arms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
had surrounded the unhappy princesses
of feudal times.</p>

<p class="indent">From time to time he had read of her;
this duke or that prince was following
her about, from resort to resort. She had
written once, but he had not had the courage
to answer that letter. Paris, London,
Berlin! Her beauty and her wealth had
conquered each city in its turn. Heigh-ho!
He held the letter as a lover holds a
woman&#39;s hand: dreamily, dim-eyed, motionless.
Finally he broke the seal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear John</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">Home again! Near to Mother Earth again, to
the old habits, old longings, old friends. I am
never going away again. Now, John, I am giving
a little Christmas Eve dinner to-night, informally,
to five literary celebrities (four who are known
and one who will be), and I want you more than
any one else. Why? Well, you are a staff of oak
to lean upon&mdash;sound and sturdy and impervious
to the storms. I want visions of the old days, and
somehow they will not come back vividly unless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
you help me to conjure them. Do you remember
<i>souviens-toi</i>?... But never mind. I&#39;ll ask
the question of you when we meet. No excuses,
John, no previous engagements. If you have an
excuse, destroy it; an engagement, break it. This
is a command. If you do not come I shall never
forgive you. What do you care if the celebrities
have never heard of you? I am sure that not one
of them is your peer at heart and mind. I am
tired, John, tired of false praises and flattery, tired
of worldly things; and somehow your voice is going
to rest me. Come at half after eight. <span class="smcap">Nell.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Home again! She was home! A dizziness
fell upon him for a space, and all
things grew blurred and indistinct. When
the vapor passed he returned the letter to
its envelope, opened a drawer in his bureau,
and brought forth an old handkerchief
case. In it there were withered
flowers, scraps of ribbon, a broken fan,
and packets of old letters. He took out
one of the packets, raised the ribbon
(torn from some gown of hers), and slid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
under this latest letter, which would
probably be the last.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, he would go. And if the celebrities
loosed their covert and fatuous smiles
when his back was turned, so be it. His
poverty was clean and honorable. He
dressed slowly, and once he gazed into the
mirror. The face he saw there was not
inspiring, lined and hollowed as it was;
but its pallor lent a refinement to it, that
tender, proud refinement which describes
a lofty soul, full of gentleness and nobility.</p>

<p class="indent">From time to time he approached
the window. How the snow whirled,
eddied, sank, and whirled again! The
arc lamps became luminous clouds. He
looked at his shoes. Could he afford a
cab? And yet, could he afford to appear
before her, his shoes wet, his clothes
damp with snow? He decided in favor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
of the cab. It was Christmas Eve; a little
luxury would not be wrong.</p>

<p class="indent">By-and-by he stepped out of the boarding-house
into the storm. Clouds of moist
feathery particles surged over him, and
crept inside his rusty velvet collar. Suddenly
he discovered a handsome coupé
standing in front. The footman was walking
up and down while the driver beat
his hands across his breast. Williard did
not understand what this elegant equipage
was doing in such a street. Even as
he cogitated, the footman descried him
and approached.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Beg pardon, sir; Mr. Williard?&quot; he
inquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I am Mr. Williard,&quot; was the
wondering answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then we are just in time, sir!&quot; The
footman ran to the coupé and opened the
door respectfully.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
&quot;You have made a mistake, my man,&quot;
said Williard. &quot;I did not order&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are from Miss Wycklift&#39;s,&quot; said
the footman.</p>

<p class="indent">Her carriage! And she had sent it to
his boarding-house for fear he might slip
past!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you certain?&quot; he asked, still in
doubt.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you are Mr. Williard there isn&#39;t
a particle of doubt, sir.&quot; The tone was
perfectly respectful, and did more to determine
Williard than anything else.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">He entered the luxurious carriage and
the door slammed behind him. Presently
he was on the way to see the one woman
in all the world. Her carriage! What a
delicate bit of charity it was, savoring of
a thoughtful mind and a warm heart!
She knew, then, of his continued poverty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
and wished to save him the embarrassment
of going to a dinner in a surface car.
There was not the least hint of patronage
in the act; it was simply one of those fine
and thoughtful impulses of which only a
noble woman is capable. He recalled the
first night he had taken her to the opera.
There had been no other woman half so
lovely&mdash;he had thought only of her. Fool
that he was to surrender to this idle
dream: but oh! it had been so sweet.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a jar, and the carriage and
Williard&#39;s reverie came to a sudden
pause. The door opened and the footman&#39;s
head appeared.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here we are, sir!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Williard, still dazed, alighted. He
mounted the steps to the door, and with
no little timidity he pushed the electric
button. Riches! How the hateful word
buzzed in his ears!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span></p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="center">II</p>

<p>A PRIM little maid opened the
door. She took his hat and
coat, and directed him to the
warm and cozy library. As he saw no
one about he believed that he had committed
the unpardonable offense of coming
too early. It was so long since he had
been &quot;out.&quot; He wandered among the
bookcases and soon forgot where he was,
for he possessed the poet&#39;s enthusiasm
for rare books. The atmosphere seemed
spirituous of Balzac, Thackeray, Dumas,
Dickens, Scott, Hugo and all the tender
poets he loved so well. And here, right
under his hand, was a rare copy of <i>Tristram
Shandy</i>. Dear, guileless old Uncle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
Toby! And then he became conscious of
a Presence.</p>

<p class="indent">He turned, and beheld her standing in
the doorway. Beautiful, beautiful! The
ivory pallor of her complexion, the
shadowy wine of her hair, her brilliant
eyes, the glistening whiteness of her neck
and arms! He stood like stone, incapable
of animation. Then he took in a deep
breath: he wished to possess absolute control
over himself before he touched her
hand. Oh, he needed no fire to warm his
veins, the blood of which gushed into his
brain like the floods of spring torrents!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;John!&quot; she cried.</p>

<p class="indent">She floated toward him, her hands
outstretched, a smile of welcome on her
lips. He touched her hands with some
uncertainty. It was all so like a dream.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you are home again?&quot; he said, finding
only this commonplace question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
among all the beautiful phrases he had
invented for her benefit.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I am glad to be home, John;
glad. I knew you would come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How in the world could I help it?&quot;
smiling. &quot;It was very kind of you to
send your carriage. A carriage is a luxury
in which I do not often indulge. I
couldn&#39;t invent any excuse; I had no engagement.
Besides, I would have come
anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She laughed, and drew two chairs to
the blazing grate and motioned him to be
seated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know,&quot; he began, &quot;but for
your note I might have forgotten all
about its being Christmas Eve? To what
terrible depths a man falls to be able to
confess such a sacrilege! But a lonely
man forgets the customs of his youth.
There is no Christmas spirit where there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
are no children, no family ties. I&#39;m a
hermit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me all about yourself, John,&quot;
she urged, cleverly seating herself so that
she might see him easily, while he, to see
her, would have to turn his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There isn&#39;t much to say. I&#39;ve just
gone right on making a failure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is no such thing as failure,
John. Failure means effort, and effort is
never failure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is a pretty way of putting it.
Well, then, let me say that I am still unsuccessful.
Fame has knocked on my
door with soft gloves, and I have not
heard her; and Fortune never had me on
her visiting list.&quot; He stared into the fire.</p>

<p class="indent">He was quite unconscious of her minute
examination. How changed he was,
poor boy! He was not growing old; he
was aging. What had wrought this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
change? Work? A long series of defeats?
Unrewarded toil? She leaned
back in her chair, and the light in her
eyes would have blinded Williard had
he turned just then.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What have you been doing this long
year?&quot; he asked presently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wanderlust. I have flitted from place
to place, always dissatisfied.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dissatisfied&mdash;you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, John. To be truly unhappy is to
be rich and unhappy. It is the hope of
some time being rich that dulls the unhappiness
of the poor. Money buys only
inanimate things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have heard of you sometimes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What have you heard?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was a prince or duke, I forget
which.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He wanted to marry me,&quot; lightly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
&quot;It was amusing. Some busybody
would always manage to introduce me
as the rich Miss Wycklift; and then the
comedy would begin. Perhaps I was
spiteful; but I knew that it was only my
money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you ever looked in your mirror?&quot;
Williard asked naively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I spend a part of the day before it,&quot;
she confessed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But money is not everything. It is
quite possible that these men loved you
for your own sake.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Loved for one&#39;s own sake,&quot; mused the
girl. &quot;Yes, that is how I would have it.
But how in the world is a rich girl going
to tell? I am superstitious. For three or
four years I have been carrying this little
amulet,&quot; she said, holding out for his inspection
a silver, thimble-like trinket.
&quot;It represents St. Joseph, the patron saint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
of spinsters. An old French nurse gave
it to me, and said that if I offered prayers
to St. Joseph I should some day find
the man I loved and who loved me. I
do not want to be a spinster.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is a graceful sentiment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not wanting to be a spinster?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, that is not only graceful but commendable,&quot;
smiling. Then he added
gravely: &quot;Have your prayers been answered?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Silence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well?&quot; he said, with the slightest
tremor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only he hasn&#39;t said anything yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He moved restlessly. It was all so sad.
Yet it was best so. Once he knew her to
be beyond his reach he could bring to an
end his foolish dream.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder how I shall begin to tell you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
my romance,&quot; she resumed. &quot;Society has
done so many evil things in the name of
formality. It has laid down impossible
and inhuman rules, destroying freedom
of thought and action. To these rules we
must conform or be ostracized. Might a
woman tell a man she loves him, John?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That depends wholly upon her
knowledge that he loves her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So if a woman knows that a man loves
her she may, in the pursuit of happiness,
tell that man?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see no reason why not. To love is
natural. Love is stronger than logic,
stronger than formality. But this should
always be borne in mind: for a woman to
propose to a man, the man must be her
equal in all things&mdash;wealth of mind and
wealth of purse.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, now you are going back to the
conventionality of things,&quot; she protested.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
&quot;How I hate conventional mediocrity!
I have hated it ever since I came to this
horrid city. Don&#39;t you sometimes long
for the old days, John: the sermons in
stones, the good in everything?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sometimes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I am going back to the old village
in the spring. John,&quot; softly, &quot;why
didn&#39;t you answer my letter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The little orbit around which I take
my flight could scarce interest you,&quot;
lamely. &quot;There were princes and dukes
in your train, and great fêtes, and bewildering
cities besides.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It hurt,&quot; she said simply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hurt? Have I hurt you?&quot; the repressed
tenderness in his voice shaking
him. &quot;Oh, if I had known that you
really wanted to hear from me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And why should I not? Were we not
boy and girl together? And you always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
wrote such charming letters, cheerful
and hopeful and sunshiny. There never
was any worldliness, nor cynicism. I
have kept all your letters; and even now
I find myself returning to them, as one
returns to old friends.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He clasped and unclasped his hands
nervously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cheerful and hopeful and sunshiny,&quot;
she went on. &quot;The man I love is like
that. He is good and cheerful and brave.
Nobody ever hears him complain. But
he is poor, John, dreadfully poor; and
what makes it so hard, he is dreadfully
proud. So I must put my own pride
underfoot and tell him that he is wrong
to spoil two lives, simply because I am
rich and he is poor. And if he rejects me
I shall throw away this little amulet, and
lose faith in everything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Williard had nothing to say. Rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
he saw himself once more in his little hall
bedroom, his face buried in packets of
old letters.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dinner is served.&quot; The butler appeared.</p>

<p class="indent">Williard rose.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, sir,&quot; she said as the butler went
out.</p>

<p class="indent">Somehow her hand slid comfortably
into his and she guided him through the
hall. The touch of her hand was ecstasy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was a time when you used to
kiss my hand,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">With the forgotten gallantry of olden
times suddenly returned, he bent his head
and kissed the hand in his, to hide his
dimming eyes!</p>

<p class="indent">They then entered the dining-room.
Covers had been laid for six. There was
a candle at each plate, but upon four of
the plates rested books! The poet looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
at the girl: ah, the brave and merry eyes
that met his!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Permit me, Mr. Williard,&quot; she said,
making a courtesy, &quot;to introduce you to
the celebrities. Yonder is Mr. Thackeray,
and next to him is Mr. Dickens; on
the opposite side are MM. de Balzac and
Dumas. Behold Mr. Esmond and Mr.
Copperfield, the kindly Cousin Pons and
the brave D&#39;Artagnan! Ah, John, I was
so afraid that you might invent an excuse
that I took to this little subterfuge. Do
you forgive me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would have come anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is a woman&#39;s answer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, because I wanted to see you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is better.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">What a fine dinner it was! With that
tact of which only a woman of the world
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
is capable she drew him out by degrees.
He became animated, merry, witty; all
the channels of his broadly educated
mind loosed their currents. He was the
poet and the man of letters.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what would you do in my place,
John?&quot; she asked finally.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As to what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As to the man whose poverty keeps
him outside my gates; this man I love,
whose pride is striving to cheat me out of
that which is mine own?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All the light went out of Williard&#39;s
eyes. He had forgotten!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are sure he loves you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; with a forced smile, &quot;this is
the last week of leap year; why not ask
him? Custom allows such action once in
four years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are not laughing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
&quot;No, I am not laughing,&quot; truthfully
enough.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;John&mdash;will you marry me?&quot; Her
voice was low, like music in a church.</p>

<p class="indent">How still everything suddenly grew!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you marry me, John; or will you
break my heart with your foolish pride?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He stared at her dumbly. She balanced
the image of St. Joseph in her
hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I toss it into the fire?&quot; she asked
presently, a weariness stealing into her
tones.</p>

<p class="indent">He tried to speak, but could not. She
made as though to fling the image into
the fire, when he leaned across the table
and caught her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m a miserable coward,&quot; he said,
choking.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So am I, John. I was afraid I might
lose you.&quot;</p>
